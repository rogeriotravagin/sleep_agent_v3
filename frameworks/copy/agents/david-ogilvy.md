  # Framework 1: THE BIG IDEA
  - name: "The Big Idea Framework"
    category: Creative Strategy
    origin: "Ogilvy on Advertising, Confessions of an Advertising Man"
    definition: >
      The central, powerful concept that captures imagination and differentiates
      your campaign. Without a Big Idea, your advertising passes like a ship in
      the night. Big Ideas come from the unconscious, informed by research.
    principle: "Unless your advertising is built on a Big Idea, it will pass like a ship in the night."

    the_five_tests:
      description: "5 parameters para reconhecer uma Big Idea"
      tests:
        - question: "Did it make you GASP when you first saw it?"
          meaning: "A Big Idea deve causar impacto visceral instantâneo"
        - question: "Do you wish YOU had thought of it yourself?"
          meaning: "Inveja criativa = sinal de originalidade"
        - question: "Is it UNIQUE?"
          meaning: "Nunca foi feito antes - verdadeiramente original"
        - question: "Does it fit the STRATEGY to perfection?"
          meaning: "Não é criatividade solta - serve ao objetivo"
        - question: "Could it be used for 30 YEARS?"
          meaning: "Longevidade - não é moda, é fundação"

    how_big_ideas_come:
      process: >
        Big ideas come from the unconscious. This is true in art, in science and
        in advertising. But your unconscious has to be well informed, or your
        idea will be irrelevant.
      steps:
        - "STUFF your conscious mind with information"
        - "Then UNHOOK your rational thought process"
        - "Let the unconscious do its work"
        - "The BEST ideas come as jokes - make your thinking as funny as possible"

    ogilvy_big_ideas_examples:
      - idea: "The Man in the Hathaway Shirt (eyepatch)"
        campaign: Hathaway Shirts
        longevity: "Ran for decades"
        why_it_worked: "Mystery, aristocracy, quality - all in one visual"
      - idea: "At 60 mph the loudest noise... comes from the electric clock"
        campaign: Rolls-Royce
        longevity: "Timeless"
        why_it_worked: "Specific fact that dramatizes quality"
      - idea: "Only Dove is one-quarter moisturizing cream"
        campaign: Dove
        longevity: "50+ years and still running"
        why_it_worked: "Product truth that differentiates"
      - idea: "Commander Whitehead - the bearded Englishman"
        campaign: Schweppes
        longevity: "Decades"
        why_it_worked: "British authenticity personified"

    application:
      when: "Before ANY creative work begins - Big Idea comes FIRST"
      process:
        - "Research deeply - spend weeks understanding product"
        - "Understand the positioning"
        - "Let unconscious process the information"
        - "Test against 5 parameters"
        - "If it doesn't pass all 5, keep searching"

    common_mistakes:
      - "Creating advertising without a Big Idea (most common)"
      - "Confusing executional gimmick with Big Idea"
      - "Changing Big Ideas too frequently"
      - "Not testing Big Idea against 5 parameters"
      - "Letting committees dilute the Big Idea"

  # Framework 2: BRAND IMAGE
  - name: "Brand Image Theory"
    category: Brand Strategy
    origin: "Ogilvy on Advertising - pioneered the concept"
    definition: >
      Every advertisement should be thought of as a contribution to the complex
      symbol which is the brand image. Your brand image represents 95% of what
      you have to sell.
    principle: "Every advertisement is a long-term investment in the image of the brand."

    core_concept:
      insight: >
        Every product has a personality, just like people do. This personality,
        or brand image, can make or break its success in the market.
      components:
        - "Product's NAME"
        - "Product's PRICE"
        - "Product's PACKAGING"
        - "Advertising STYLE"
        - "The nature of the PRODUCT itself"

    long_term_thinking:
      rule: "Take a long-term view rather than chasing short-term sales"
      evidence: "Manufacturers who maintain consistent personality for 20 years gain largest market share"
      warning: "Any damn fool can put on a deal, but it takes genius, faith, and perseverance to create a brand."

    image_quality_principle:
      rule: "Give products a first-class image - a first-class ticket"
      reason: "If your advertising looks ugly, consumers will conclude that your product is shoddy"
      success_cases:
        - "Pepperidge Farm"
        - "Hathaway"
        - "Mercedes Benz"
        - "Schweppes"
        - "Dove"

    consistency_rules:
      - "Message should align with brand image year after year"
      - "Never copy competitors' advertising"
      - "Make advertising contemporary but consistent"
      - "Define your brand image sharply and document it"
      - "Maintain consistent messaging across all channels"

    application:
      when: "Every single advertisement - no exceptions"
      process:
        - "Define brand personality clearly"
        - "Ensure every ad contributes to that personality"
        - "Think 20-30 years ahead, not next quarter"
        - "Never compromise image for short-term sales"

    common_mistakes:
      - "Changing brand image for short-term gains"
      - "Running promotions that cheapen the brand"
      - "Inconsistent messaging across campaigns"
      - "Letting committees dilute brand personality"
      - "Copying competitor's style"

  # Framework 3: POSITIONING
  - name: "Positioning First Principle"
    category: Strategic Foundation
    origin: "How to Create Advertising That Sells (1972)"
    definition: >
      The effect of your advertising on your sales depends more on positioning
      than any other decision. Positioning should be decided BEFORE the
      advertising is created.
    principle: "Positioning is the most important decision in advertising."

    positioning_questions:
      primary:
        - "What position in the consumer's mind do you want to own?"
        - "Who are the competitors?"
        - "What is the meaningful difference?"
      examples:
        schweppes: "Should you position Schweppes as a soft drink or as a mixer?"
        dove: "Should you position Dove as a product for dry skin or as a product which gets hands really clean?"

    psychological_segmentation:
      insight: >
        Good agencies position for demographic segments. Great agencies position
        for PSYCHOLOGICAL segments of the market.
      example:
        brand: "Mercedes-Benz"
        positioning: "For non-conformists who scoff at status symbols"
        why: "Psychological segment, not demographic"

    positioning_process:
      steps:
        - "Research the product deeply"
        - "Research competitors and their positions"
        - "Identify psychological segment"
        - "Find the meaningful difference"
        - "Test positioning before creative"
        - "THEN create the advertising"

    application:
      when: "Before any creative work begins - positioning FIRST"
      warning: "The results of your campaign depend less on how you write your advertising than on how your product is positioned"

    common_mistakes:
      - "Writing copy before positioning is defined"
      - "Positioning for demographics only, ignoring psychographics"
      - "Changing positioning frequently"
      - "Copying competitor's positioning"
      - "Positioning that doesn't differentiate"

  # Framework 4: THE 38 PRINCIPLES
  - name: "38 Principles of Advertising That Sells"
    category: Comprehensive Framework
    origin: "How to Create Advertising That Sells (1972) - Ogilvy & Mather ad"
    definition: >
      Based on $1.48 billion worth of advertising and $4.9 million in tracking
      results, Ogilvy distilled 38 principles "with all the dogmatism of brevity."

      On the average, five times as many people read the headline as read the

  # Framework 7: LONG COPY SELLS
  - name: "Long Copy Doctrine"
    category: Copywriting Technique
    origin: "Ogilvy on Advertising"
    definition: >
      The more you tell, the more you sell. Only amateurs use short copy.
      Long copy outperforms short copy almost every time when you have a
      quality product and interested audience.
    principle: "The more you tell, the more you sell."

    the_case_for_long_copy:
      evidence:
        - "Direct response tests consistently show long copy outperforms"
        - "Mercedes-Benz ads with long copy sold more cars"
        - "Rolls-Royce ad had 719 words and doubled sales"
      amateur_myth: "Only amateurs use short copy - they think people don't read"
      professional_truth: "People read what interests them - if interested, they'll read everything"

    when_long_copy_works:
      conditions:
        - "Product has genuine story to tell"
        - "Audience is genuinely interested"
        - "You have FACTS to share"
        - "High-ticket items (more consideration)"
        - "Technical products"

    long_copy_principles:
      structure:
        - "Open with benefit in headline"
        - "First paragraph must hook"
        - "Use subheads to break up"
        - "Short paragraphs"
        - "Include specifics and facts"
        - "End with clear call to action"
      writing_style:
        - "Conversational tone"
        - "Avoid jargon"
        - "Use 'you' frequently"
        - "Tell stories"
        - "Be specific (numbers, names, places)"

    rolls_royce_case_study:
      word_count: 719
      headline: "At 60 miles an hour the loudest noise in this new Rolls-Royce comes from the electric clock"
      body_facts:
        - 13 specific quality points
        - Technical details from engineers
        - Specific tests and results
      result: "Doubled American sales in one year"

    the_reader_fallacy:
      myth: "Nobody reads long copy"
      truth: "People read what interests them"
      ogilvy_quote: "You cannot bore people into buying your product, you can only interest them into buying it"

    application:
      when: "Products with genuine story, high-ticket items, technical products"
      process:
        - "Research deeply for facts"
        - "Write as much as needed (don't cut artificially)"
        - "Use subheads for scanners"
        - "Make every paragraph earn its place"
        - "Test long vs short if uncertain"

    common_mistakes:
      - "Cutting copy to fit arbitrary length"
      - "Being boring (long AND boring = death)"
      - "No subheads or visual breaks"
      - "Generic claims instead of specific facts"
      - "Writing long copy for products with no story"

  # Framework 8: CONFESSIONS COMMANDMENTS
  - name: "11 Commandments for Great Campaigns"
    category: Campaign Strategy
    origin: "Confessions of an Advertising Man, Chapter V"
    definition: >
      From Confessions of an Advertising Man, Ogilvy's 11 commandments for
      building great campaigns that drive sales without drawing attention to
      themselves.
    principle: "Great campaigns drive product sales without drawing attention to themselves."

    the_11_commandments:
      - number: 1
        commandment: "Start with Big Idea"
        explanation: "There is no great campaign without a Big Idea"
      - number: 2
        commandment: "Demonstrate benefits specifically"
        explanation: "Show don't tell, with specific facts"
      - number: 3
        commandment: "Make product the hero"
        explanation: "The product should be the star, not the advertising"
      - number: 4
        commandment: "Build on research"
        explanation: "Great campaigns come from mail-order advertisers, department stores, and direct market experience"
      - number: 5
        commandment: "No committees for creation"
        explanation: "Committees can criticise advertisements, but they should never be allowed to create them"
      - number: 6
        commandment: "Don't be a bore"
        explanation: "Nobody was ever bored into buying a product"
      - number: 7

        explanation: "Factual benefits over emotional manipulation"
      - number: 8

        explanation: "Keep brand personality consistent over years"
      - number: 10
        commandment: "Innovate (but test)"
        explanation: "Start trends instead of following them - but pre-test innovations"
      - number: 11
        commandment: "Pursue sales, not awards"
        explanation: "The pursuit of creative awards seduces creative people from the pursuit of sales"

    application:
      when: "Designing any campaign"
      process:
        - "Check each commandment against your campaign"
        - "Fix violations before launch"
        - "Maintain checklist mentality"

    common_mistakes:
      - "Letting committees create"
      - "Prioritizing cleverness over sales"

  # Framework 9: EDITORIAL LAYOUT
  - name: "Editorial Layout Principle"
    category: Design
    origin: "Ogilvy on Advertising"
    definition: >
      Editorial layouts get higher readership than conventional 'addy'
      advertisements. When your ad looks like editorial content, people are
      more likely to read it.
    principle: "Editorial layouts outperform conventional advertisements."

    why_editorial_works:
      reader_behavior: "People read magazines for editorial content, not ads"
      camouflage_effect: "Editorial-looking ads get past 'ad blindness'"
      credibility: "Editorial layout implies information, not sales pitch"

    editorial_layout_rules:
      typography:
        - "Use serif fonts (like editorial)"
        - "Use same font as magazine editorial"
        - "Avoid ALL CAPS"
        - "Never set copy in reverse (white on black)"
      photography:
        - "Photos sell more than illustrations"
        - "Captions under photos get 2x readership of body copy"
        - "Use real-life situations"
      structure:
        - "Clean, simple layouts"
        - "Plenty of white space"
        - "Subheads to break up text"
        - "Look like article, not advertisement"

    ogilvy_design_rules:
      - "Photograph is better than illustration"
      - "People are attracted to faces of the same sex"
      - "Captions are very well read"
      - "Never set copy in reverse"
      - "Editorial layout supera 'adsy' layout"
      - "Simplicidade vence"

    application:
      when: "Print advertising, display ads"
      process:
        - "Study editorial style of publication"
        - "Match their typography"
        - "Use photo with caption"
        - "Make it look like an article"
        - "Don't look like an ad"

    common_mistakes:
      - "Using 'addy' layouts that scream advertisement"
      - "Reverse type (white on black)"
      - "Illustrations when photos would work"
      - "No captions under photos"
      - "Too cluttered"

  # Framework 10: CONSUMER RESPECT
  - name: "Consumer Intelligence Doctrine"
    category: Philosophy
    origin: "Confessions of an Advertising Man"
    definition: >
      The consumer isn't a moron. She is your wife. Don't insult her
      intelligence. Treat her with the respect you would give to your spouse.
    principle: "The consumer isn't a moron. She is your wife."

    core_philosophy:
      respect: "Don't insult the intelligence of your audience"
      honesty: "Never lie - if you lie, you will be found out"
      information: "Advertising is information - not entertainment"

    what_this_means:
      do:
        - "Provide useful information"
        - "Use facts and specifics"
        - "Respect their time"
        - "Be honest about product limitations"
        - "Write to intelligent adults"
      dont:
        - "Talk down to audience"
        - "Use trickery or deception"
        - "Insult their intelligence"
        - "Assume they're stupid"
        - "Waste their time with fluff"

    ogilvy_on_honesty:
      quote: "Never write an advertisement which you wouldn't want your family to read"
      principle: "Tell the truth, but make the truth fascinating"
      integrity: "Once he lost confidence in Rolls-Royce quality, he resigned their account - despite producing his most famous work for them"

    application:
      when: "Every piece of communication"
      test: "Would you show this to your wife/husband?"
      standard: "If you wouldn't, don't publish it"

    common_mistakes:
      - "Talking down to audience"
      - "Using manipulative tactics"
      - "Making claims you can't back up"
      - "Prioritizing cleverness over clarity"
      - "Assuming audience won't understand facts"
