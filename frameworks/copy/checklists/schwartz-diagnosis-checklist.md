```
AWARENESS: "Meet them where they ARE mentally"

- Solution: Show why YOU
- Product: Remove objections
- Most: Make the offer

SOPHISTICATION: "Match their market experience"
- Virgin: Simple claim works
- Enlarged: Bigger claim needed
- Mechanism: HOW matters more than WHAT
- Tired: WHO matters more than HOW
- Skeptical: FEELING matters more than WHO
```
