# Hopkins Audit Checklist

## Purpose

Quick-reference checklist for validating copy against Claude Hopkins' scientific advertising principles. Use this as a final gate before any copy goes live.

## How to Use

1. Go through each section
2. Check items that PASS
3. Items without checks need revision
4. Aim for 90%+ pass rate before publishing
5. Critical items (marked **CRITICAL**) must ALL pass

---

## Section 1: Headline Validation

Hopkins: "Headlines can change results by 500%. The purpose of a headline is to pick out people you can interest."

```
□ **CRITICAL** Headline selects specific audience (not "everyone")
□ **CRITICAL** Clear benefit promised or implied
□ Curiosity gap created (reason to read more)
□ No clever wordplay that obscures meaning
□ Would work as first line of sales conversation
□ Multiple variations available for testing
□ Tracking code assigned for measurement

HEADLINE QUICK TEST:
"If I shouted this in a crowd, would the RIGHT people turn around?"
□ Yes, specific people would identify
□ No, too generic → REVISE
```

---

## Section 2: Lead/Opening Validation

Hopkins: "The best ads ask no one to buy. They are based entirely on service."

```
□ **CRITICAL** Opens with reader's interest, not seller's
□ First paragraph pulls reader into rest of copy
□ No "we're excited to announce" or similar
□ Provides value before asking for anything
□ Creates curiosity about what comes next
□ Demonstrates understanding of reader's situation

LEAD QUICK TEST:
"Would reader get value if they stopped reading here?"
□ Yes, something useful learned
□ No, just pitch setup → REVISE
```

---

## Section 3: Claims & Reason Why Validation

Hopkins: "If a claim is worth making, make it in the most impressive way - by explaining WHY."

```
CLAIM INVENTORY:
For EACH claim in the copy:

Claim 1: _________________________
□ Has "Reason Why" (process/mechanism explained)
□ Specific proof attached
□ Reader understands WHY it's true

Claim 2: _________________________
□ Has "Reason Why"
□ Specific proof attached
□ Reader understands WHY it's true

Claim 3: _________________________
□ Has "Reason Why"
□ Specific proof attached
□ Reader understands WHY it's true

(Continue for all claims)

**CRITICAL** No claims without "Reason Why"
**CRITICAL** No claims without proof

REASON WHY QUICK TEST:
"If reader asks 'Why should I believe that?', do I have a specific answer?"
□ Yes, with process/proof → PASS
□ No, just assertion → FAIL, add proof
```

---

## Section 4: Specificity Validation

Hopkins: "Platitudes and generalities roll off the human understanding like water from a duck."

```
GENERALITY SCAN - Flag any of these vague terms:

□ "Best" appears → Replace with: _____________
□ "Leading" appears → Replace with: _____________
□ "Quality" appears → Replace with: _____________
□ "Fast" appears → Replace with: _____________
□ "Many" appears → Replace with: _____________
□ "Effective" appears → Replace with: _____________
□ "Affordable" appears → Replace with: _____________
□ "Premium" appears → Replace with: _____________
□ "Top" appears → Replace with: _____________
□ "Excellent" appears → Replace with: _____________

**CRITICAL** Zero vague superlatives without proof

NUMBER CHECK:
□ Numbers are specific (37.4% not "about 40%")
□ Numbers are odd when possible (2,847 not 3,000)
□ Sources cited for statistics
□ Timeframes are exact ("4 days" not "fast")
□ Results are measurable ("$847 saved" not "save money")

SPECIFICITY QUICK TEST:
"Could a competitor copy this claim word-for-word?"
□ No, my specifics are unique → PASS
□ Yes, it's generic → FAIL, add specifics
```

---

## Section 5: Service & Value Validation

Hopkins: "The best ads ask no one to buy. They are based entirely on service."

```
□ **CRITICAL** Copy provides genuine value before asking for sale
□ Reader learns something useful regardless of purchase
□ Copy demonstrates expertise through teaching
□ Not just features → shows application and benefit
□ Positions as helpful expert, not desperate seller
□ Information would be useful even without product mention

VALUE RATIO CHECK:
What % of copy is educational vs pitch?
□ 60%+ educational → PASS
□ Less than 60% → Consider adding more value

SERVICE QUICK TEST:
"If I removed the product/CTA, would remaining content be worth reading?"
□ Yes, genuinely helpful → PASS
□ No, just pitch → FAIL, add real value
```

---

## Section 6: Proof & Credibility Validation

Hopkins: "People are like sheep. They cannot judge values. We go with the crowd."

```
TESTIMONIALS:
□ Present and visible
□ Include specific results (not just "Great product!")
□ Attributed to real people (name, location, photo if possible)
□ Relevant to target audience
□ Variety of testimonials for different objections

AUTHORITY MARKERS:
□ Credentials displayed (certifications, media mentions)
□ Numbers that demonstrate scale (customers, years, results)
□ Third-party validation (reviews, ratings, awards)

SOCIAL PROOF:
□ Number of customers/users mentioned
□ "People like you" evidence
□ Case studies or examples

PROOF QUICK TEST:
"Would a skeptic believe this?"
□ Yes, proof is compelling → PASS
□ No, needs more evidence → FAIL, add proof
```

## Section 7: Offer & Risk Reversal Validation

Hopkins: "The product itself should be its own best salesman."

```
□ **CRITICAL** Offer is crystal clear (what they get)
□ **CRITICAL** Price/investment is clearly stated
□ Value demonstrated exceeds price
□ Risk reversal present (guarantee, trial, sample)
□ Guarantee terms are specific and generous
□ Easy to understand what happens next

GUARANTEE CHECK:
□ Money-back guarantee present
□ Time period is generous (30+ days ideal)
□ Process for guarantee is simple
□ No hidden conditions or "gotchas"

OFFER QUICK TEST:
"Is buying this a no-brainer given the guarantee?"
□ Yes, risk is on seller → PASS
□ No, buyer bears too much risk → FAIL, strengthen guarantee
```

---

## Section 8: CTA & Response Validation

Hopkins: "Every advertising question should be answered by the salesman's standards."

```
□ **CRITICAL** CTA is clear (one obvious next step)
□ CTA uses action language (Get, Start, Claim, etc.)
□ Urgency is real, not manufactured
□ Multiple CTAs for long copy (but all same action)
□ Easy to complete desired action
□ No friction in response mechanism

CTA QUICK TEST:
"Does reader know EXACTLY what to do next?"
□ Yes, one clear action → PASS
□ No, multiple options or unclear → FAIL, simplify
```

---

## Section 9: Testability & Tracking Validation

Hopkins: "Almost any question can be answered, cheaply, quickly and finally, by a test campaign."

```
□ **CRITICAL** Tracking code assigned (UTM, coupon, etc.)
□ Primary success metric defined
□ Secondary metrics identified
□ Multiple headline variations prepared for testing
□ Attribution possible to this specific piece
□ ROI calculable after campaign

TRACKING QUICK TEST:
"Can I measure exactly how this copy performed?"
□ Yes, tracking in place → PASS
□ No, no measurement possible → FAIL, add tracking
```

---

## Section 10: Salesmanship Validation

Hopkins: "Advertising is salesmanship. Its principles are the principles of salesmanship."

```
□ **CRITICAL** Reads like conversation, not corporate speak
□ Written to ONE specific person, not "dear valued customer"
□ Uses "you" more than "we/our/us"
□ Addresses real objections
□ Would work as face-to-face sales pitch
□ No jargon or buzzwords
□ Simple language (8th grade reading level)

SALESMANSHIP QUICK TEST:
"Would a top salesperson say this to a prospect face-to-face?"
□ Yes, natural conversation → PASS
□ No, too formal/corporate/clever → FAIL, make conversational
```
