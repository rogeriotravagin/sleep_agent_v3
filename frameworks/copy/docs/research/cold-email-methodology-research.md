### 3.1 Alex Berman - Cold Email Manifesto {#alex-berman}

Alex Berman has generated over $100M in sales via cold email and helped 14,000+ clients book 500,000+ sales meetings.

#### Core Philosophy

"Cold email is the cockroach of marketing. Trends come and go, but email is permanent. The key is hyper-relevance and genuine value."

#### The Berman Method

```
1. RESEARCH FIRST
   - 10-15 minutes per prospect minimum
   - Find trigger events
   - Understand their business model
   - Identify specific pain points

2. PERSONALIZE GENUINELY
   - Reference something specific to THEM
   - Show you've done homework
   - Never use obvious templates

3. LEAD WITH VALUE
   - What can you GIVE before you ask?
   - Case studies of similar companies
   - Specific insight about their business

4. ONE CLEAR CTA
   - Single, simple ask
   - Low friction response
   - Easy to say yes to
```

#### Berman's Email Structure

```
LINE 1: PERSONALIZED OBSERVATION
[Something specific about their company/content/news]

LINE 2-3: THE BRIDGE
"I noticed this because [relevant connection to what you do]"

LINE 4-5: THE VALUE
"We helped [similar company] achieve [specific result]"

LINE 6: THE ASK
"Worth a 15-min call to see if relevant?"

SIGNATURE: Simple, no novels
```

#### The "Baking Method" (Follow-Up)

Berman's follow-up sequence that "never gets ghosted":

```
FOLLOW-UP 1 (Day 3):
Short, adds new value
"Forgot to mention - [new relevant detail]"

FOLLOW-UP 2 (Day 7):
Case study or social proof
"Thought you'd find this relevant: [result/case study]"

FOLLOW-UP 3 (Day 14):
Permission-based soft close
"Should I close this out or worth one more look?"

FOLLOW-UP 4 (Day 21):
Breakup email
"Looks like timing isn't right. Will check back in Q[X]."
```

### 3.2 BASHO Email Method {#basho-method}

The BASHO method creates hyper-personalized emails that achieve 88% higher response rates. Named after the famous Japanese poet known for minimalism and precision.

#### Core Principle

"88% of people are more likely to reply if the email was specifically written for them. BASHO emails look and feel like they could ONLY have been sent to that one person."

#### BASHO Email Components

```
1. RESEARCH REQUIREMENT
   - Minimum 15 minutes researching the prospect
   - Find 3+ unique data points
   - Identify the "only them" angle

2. PERSONALIZATION DEPTH
   Level 1: Name + Company (baseline, not enough)
   Level 2: Role + Industry challenges (better)
   Level 3: Specific content they created (good)
   Level 4: Insight about their specific situation (BASHO level)

3. RELEVANCE CONNECTION
   - Why you're reaching out NOW
   - Why you're reaching out to THEM
   - Why this matters to THEIR situation

4. BREVITY
   - Under 100 words ideally
   - Every word earns its place
   - No fluff, no filler
```

#### BASHO Email Template

```
Subject: [Something only they would recognize]

[First name],

[Bridge to why you're reaching out - 1 sentence]

[Specific value or result relevant to them - 1 sentence]

[Simple, low-friction CTA - 1 sentence]

[First name]
[Simple signature]
```

#### BASHO Research Checklist

```
BEFORE WRITING, FIND:

□ Their specific role and responsibilities
□ Challenges specific to their industry/company
□ Mutual connections or shared experiences
□ Something unexpected or unique about them
```

```

- Create immediate relevance

VALUE (Middle):
- One clear benefit
