# Deep Research: Offer Evaluation Methodology

**Research ID:** offer-evaluation-methodology
**Date:** 2026-01-23
**Purpose:** Comprehensive research for upgrading `evaluate-offer.md` task
**Target:** 500+ lines of research with primary sources
**Domain:** Direct Response Marketing + Offer Creation

---

## Executive Summary

An offer is not just a product with a price—it's the complete package of value, risk reversal, and positioning that determines whether prospects say "yes" or "I need to think about it." This research synthesizes the most powerful offer evaluation frameworks from Alex Hormozi ($100M Offers), Dan Kennedy (Magnetic Marketing), and conversion optimization science to create a comprehensive audit methodology.

**Core Insight:** The goal of offer evaluation is to identify the gap between your current offer and a "Grand Slam Offer"—one so good that prospects feel stupid saying no.

---

## Part 1: The Value Equation Framework

### 1.1 Alex Hormozi's Value Equation

The foundational framework for understanding and evaluating offers:

```
                 Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood
Value = ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
              Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice
```

**Key Insight:** Value is NOT just about the numerator (outcomes). Reducing the denominator (time, effort) can dramatically increase perceived value even without changing the product.

### 1.2 Component Deep Dive

#### DREAM OUTCOME (Numerator - Weight: 30%)

**Definition:** The ideal end result your customer desires—what they truly want to achieve.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

| Criterion | Score 1-3 | Score 4-6 | Score 7-10 |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Specificity | Vague outcome | Somewhat defined | Crystal clear, measurable |
| Desirability | Nice to have | Important goal | Life-changing/urgent |
| Status Change | No identity shift | Some recognition | Transforms how they're seen |
| Emotional Pull | Logical appeal | Some emotion | Deep emotional resonance |

**Questions to Audit:**
1. Can the customer visualize the exact result?
2. Would they brag about achieving this to friends?
3. Does it solve a painful problem or fulfill a deep desire?
4. Is the outcome specific enough to measure?

**Red Flags:**
- "Improve your business" (too vague)
- No emotional language
- Outcome that's hard to picture
- Generic benefit everyone claims

**Green Flags:**
- "Add $50K/month in 90 days" (specific, measurable)
- Identity transformation language ("Become a...")
- Vivid before/after contrast
- Unique mechanism or approach

---

#### PERCEIVED LIKELIHOOD OF ACHIEVEMENT (Numerator - Weight: 30%)

**Definition:** How much the prospect believes they will actually achieve the dream outcome with your offer.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

| Criterion | Score 1-3 | Score 4-6 | Score 7-10 |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Proof | No evidence | Some testimonials | Overwhelming proof |
| Credibility | Unknown source | Some authority | Recognized expert |
| Guarantee | None or weak | Standard guarantee | Bold risk reversal |
| Mechanism | No explanation | Basic method | Unique, believable system |

**Proof Hierarchy (from weakest to strongest):**
1. Claims without evidence
2. Statistics without source
3. Third-party statistics
4. Case studies
5. Before/after documentation
6. Video testimonials
7. Celebrity/expert endorsements
8. Media features
9. Independent verification

**Questions to Audit:**
1. How many customer success stories exist?
2. Are testimonials specific (numbers, timeframes)?
3. Is there a logical explanation for why this works?
4. Does the guarantee remove all risk?

**Red Flags:**
- "Results may vary" (signals low confidence)
- Generic testimonials ("Great product!")
- No explanation of method
- Conditional or weak guarantee

**Green Flags:**
- Specific, verified results with names and details
- Clear methodology explained
- Bold guarantee ("Double your money or 2x refund")
- Third-party validation

---

#### TIME DELAY (Denominator - Weight: 20%)

**Definition:** How long until the customer sees the dream outcome.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

| Criterion | Score 1-3 | Score 4-6 | Score 7-10 |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Speed to First Win | Weeks/months | Days | Hours/immediate |
| Total Timeline | Years | Months | Weeks |
| Visibility | No progress tracking | Occasional updates | Clear milestones |
| Perceived Speed | Slower than expected | On pace | Faster than expected |

**Critical Insight:** Perceived time matters more than actual time. A 90-day program with weekly wins feels faster than a 30-day program with no feedback.

**Questions to Audit:**
1. Is there a quick win in the first 24-48 hours?
2. Are progress milestones clearly defined?
3. What's the total time to the main result?
4. How does this compare to alternatives?

**Red Flags:**
- No quick win promised
- Vague timeline ("Results vary")
- Long time to any visible progress
- Slower than competitors

**Green Flags:**
- "First results in 24 hours"
- Clear timeline with milestones
- Progress tracking built in
- Faster than alternatives

---

#### EFFORT & SACRIFICE (Denominator - Weight: 20%)

**Definition:** What the customer must do or give up to achieve the dream outcome.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

| Criterion | Score 1-3 | Score 4-6 | Score 7-10 |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Effort Required | Major work | Moderate effort | Minimal/done for you |
| Sacrifices | Many things given up | Some trade-offs | No lifestyle change |
| Complexity | Difficult to follow | Manageable | Simple/foolproof |
| Obstacles | Many blockers | Some addressed | All pre-solved |

**The "Done For You" Spectrum:**
1. DIY (customer does everything)
2. DWY (done with you, guided)
3. DFY (done for you, full service)

**Questions to Audit:**
1. How much work does the customer actually do?
2. What do they have to give up (time, money, comfort)?
3. Are common obstacles pre-solved?
4. How simple are the instructions?

**Red Flags:**
- Requires major lifestyle changes
- Complex, multi-step process
- Obstacles left for customer to solve
- Requires skills they don't have

**Green Flags:**
- "Done for you" elements
- Step-by-step simplicity
- Obstacles pre-solved
- Templates, tools provided

---

### 1.3 Value Equation Scoring

**Composite Score Calculation:**

```
Numerator Score = (Dream Outcome × 0.3) + (Perceived Likelihood × 0.3)
Denominator Score = ((10 - Time Delay) × 0.2) + ((10 - Effort) × 0.2)
Final Score = Numerator Score + Denominator Score
```

**Score Interpretation:**

| Score | Rating | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 0-3 | Broken | Complete rebuild needed |
| 4-5 | Weak | Major restructuring required |
| 6-7 | Decent | Optimization opportunities |
| 8-9 | Good | Fine-tuning needed |
| 10 | Grand Slam | Scale and protect |

## Part 2: Grand Slam Offer Components

### 2.1 The Five Elements

A "Grand Slam Offer" (term from Hormozi) has five mandatory components:

#### 1. STARVING CROWD (Market)

**Evaluation Questions:**
- Is the market actively looking for solutions?
- Do they have money to spend?
- Is the pain urgent or just nice to solve?
- Can you reach them efficiently?

**Red Flags:**
- Market needs education about the problem
- Low purchasing power
- Nice-to-have, not must-have
- Fragmented, hard to reach

**Green Flags:**
- Active problem awareness
- Demonstrated willingness to pay
- Urgent pain point
- Concentrated, accessible market

---

#### 2. IRRESISTIBLE OFFER

**The Value Stack Test:**
Does your offer include multiple components that each have standalone value?

**Value Stack Formula:**
```
Component 1: [Specific deliverable] - Value: $X
Component 2: [Specific deliverable] - Value: $Y
Component 3: [Specific deliverable] - Value: $Z
...
Total Perceived Value: $[Sum]
Your Price: $[Much less than sum]
```

**Rule of Thumb:** Perceived value should be 10x the price minimum.

**Evaluation Questions:**
- Is the value stack clearly itemized?
- Does each item have a specific dollar value?
- Is total perceived value 10x+ the price?
- Are components genuinely valuable standalone?

---

#### 3. UNIQUE MECHANISM

**Definition:** The proprietary system, method, or approach that makes your offer different and explains why it works.

**Mechanism Evaluation:**
- Does it have a unique name?
- Is it clearly explained?
- Does it differentiate from competitors?
- Does it create "this is different" belief?

**Examples:**
- Weight loss: "The Hormonal Reset Method" (not just "diet plan")
- Business: "The 3M System" (not just "marketing help")
- Course: "The RMBC Framework" (not just "copywriting training")

**Red Flags:**
- No named methodology
- Sounds like everything else
- No explanation of "why this works"
- Commodity positioning

**Green Flags:**
- Proprietary, named system
- Clear differentiation
- Logical explanation of mechanism
- Creates curiosity and belief

---

#### 4. RISK REVERSAL (Guarantee)

**Guarantee Strength Hierarchy:**

| Level | Type | Strength |
|-------|------|----------|
| 1 | No guarantee | Weakest |
| 2 | Satisfaction guarantee | Weak |
| 3 | Money-back guarantee | Standard |
| 4 | Extended money-back (90+ days) | Strong |
| 5 | Performance-based guarantee | Stronger |
| 6 | Better than money-back | Strongest |

**Better Than Money-Back Examples:**
- "If you don't [result], we'll refund you AND pay you $500"
- "If you don't [result], I'll personally [service] until you do"
- "Results guaranteed or triple your money back"

**Evaluation Questions:**
- Does the guarantee remove ALL customer risk?
- Is it specific, not generic?
- Is it better than competitors?
- Does it demonstrate confidence?

**Red Flags:**
- No guarantee mentioned
- Generic "satisfaction guaranteed"
- Many conditions and exclusions
- Shorter than industry standard

**Green Flags:**
- Bold, specific guarantee
- Performance-based (tied to outcomes)
- Longer than expected
- Better than competitors

---

#### 5. URGENCY/SCARCITY

**Urgency Types:**

| Type | Example | Validity |
|------|---------|----------|
| Real quantity | "Only 10 spots in this cohort" | Must be true |
| Real deadline | "Doors close Friday" | Must be enforced |
| Real price increase | "Price goes up $100 tomorrow" | Must happen |
| Bonus expiration | "Free consultation only this week" | Acceptable |
| Fake scarcity | "Only 3 left!" (always says 3) | Destroys trust |

**Evaluation Questions:**
- Is the scarcity/urgency real?
- Is it clearly communicated?
- Is there a consequence of waiting?
- Is it believable?

**Red Flags:**
- Fake countdown timers
- "Only X left" that never changes
- No deadline or constraint
- Urgency that feels manipulative

**Green Flags:**
- Real, verifiable limits
- Clear deadline with consequence
- Logical reason for constraint
- Urgency that creates FOMO

## Part 3: Dan Kennedy's Offer Principles

### 3.1 The 10 Rules of Direct Response Offers

From Kennedy's "No B.S. Direct Marketing":

#### Rule 1: There Must Always Be an Offer
Every marketing piece needs a specific, clear offer—not just information about your product.

**Audit Question:** Is there a clear, specific offer (not just "buy our stuff")?

#### Rule 2: There Must Be a Reason to Respond NOW
Without urgency, prospects procrastinate and never return.

**Audit Question:** Why should they act today instead of tomorrow?

#### Rule 3: Clear Instructions on How to Respond
Never assume prospects know what to do next.

**Audit Question:** Is the next step crystal clear?

#### Rule 4: There Must Be Tracking and Measurement
If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.

**Audit Question:** Can you track where sales come from?

#### Rule 5: Brand-Building is a By-Product, Not the Goal
Direct response prioritizes measurable action over brand awareness.

**Audit Question:** Does every element drive toward action?

#### Rule 6: No One-Step Marketing
Follow-up sequences are essential—most sales happen after multiple touches.

**Audit Question:** Is there a follow-up system?

#### Rule 7: Strong Sales Copy
Words matter—every word should earn its place.

**Audit Question:** Is the copy compelling and specific?

#### Rule 8: Results Rule
Test everything, let results determine winners.

**Audit Question:** Are you testing variations?

### 3.2 Kennedy's Offer Construction Formula

**The 7 Dimensions of an Irresistible Offer:**

1. **The Promise** - What specific outcome do you guarantee?
2. **The Proof** - Why should they believe you?
3. **The Price** - What's the investment?
4. **The Premium** - What extras are included?
5. **The Proposition** - What's the deal structure?
6. **The Push** - Why act now?
7. **The Permission** - What's the risk reversal?

| Complex offer | Confused prospects | Simplify, single focus |
| No urgency | "I'll think about it" | Real deadline or scarcity |
| Price-first presentation | Price objections | Lead with value, anchor high |

### 4.3 Market Red Flags

| Red Flag | Signal | Fix |
|----------|--------|-----|
| Shrinking market | Hard to find new customers | Pivot or niche |
| Price race to bottom | Commoditization | Differentiate or exit |
| Low awareness | Too much education needed | Target aware audiences |
