## Part 1: Core CRO Audit Frameworks

### 1.1 MECLABS Conversion Sequence Heuristic

The patented MECLABS framework provides a scientific approach to conversion optimization:

**The Formula:**
```
C = 4M + 3V + 2(i-f) - 2a
```

Where:
- **C** = Probability of Conversion
- **M** = Motivation of user (when)
- **V** = Clarity of Value Proposition (why)
- **i** = Incentive to take action
- **f** = Friction elements of the process
- **a** = Anxiety about entering information

**Five Factors Framework:**

| Factor | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Motivation | 4x | User's pre-existing desire |
| Value Proposition | 3x | Perceived value vs. cost |
| Incentive | 2x | Additional reasons to act now |
| Friction | -2x | Difficulty/length of process |
| Anxiety | -2x | Concerns about trust/security |

**Key Insight:** Motivation (4x) is the highest weighted factor - you can't create motivation, only amplify existing desire. Focus on attracting the right audience first.

### 1.2 CXL Heuristic Analysis Framework

Peep Laja's systematic approach to conversion audits:

**The LIFT Model:**
1. **Value Proposition** - Primary driver of conversion
2. **Relevance** - Does it match visitor expectations?
3. **Clarity** - Is the message clear?
4. **Anxiety** - What concerns exist?
5. **Distraction** - What pulls attention away?
6. **Urgency** - Is there reason to act now?

**Audit Process:**
1. Heuristic analysis (expert review)
2. Technical analysis (speed, mobile, tracking)
3. Analytics review (bounce, exit, flow)
4. User testing (recordings, surveys)
5. Hypothesis prioritization (PIE framework)

## Part 2: Alex Hormozi's Value Equation

5. **Effort Required** - How easy?
6. **Guarantee** - Risk reversal
7. **Bonuses** - Value stack
8. **Urgency** - Why now?

- "Start my free course" > "Start your free course"

### 8.3 CTA Placement

**Multiple CTAs (Rule of 3):**
1. Above the fold (primary)
2. After value proposition section
3. Bottom of page (after all content)

**Sticky CTA:**
