# Ralph Progress Log

> **AIOS Integration:** This log follows Dev Agent Record principles.
> Patterns compound across iterations. File List tracks all changes.

**Project:** CopywriterOS Agent Upgrade - Super Complete
**Branch:** ralph/copywriter-agent-upgrade
**Started:** 2026-01-17
**Status:** In Progress

---

## Codebase Patterns (KEEP AT TOP)

> **AIOS Principle:** Patterns discovered are shared across all iterations.
> Ralph reads this section FIRST before implementing.

### Architecture Patterns

- **Agent Structure (Hormozi Standard):** Each copywriter is a markdown file with YAML block containing:
  - `agent:` - Core definition (name, id, title, icon, era, customization)
  - `persona:` - Role, style, identity, focus
  - `core_principles:` - 5-10 guiding principles
  - `commands:` - Agent commands (*framework, *phrase, etc)
  - `operational_frameworks:` - 5-10 detailed frameworks with name, category, origin, definition, principle, steps, application, example, common_mistakes
  - `communication_dna:` - Vocabulary (mandatory/forbidden), rhetorical devices, quick formulas
  - `signature_phrases:` - 30-50 phrases organized by tier (core_mantras, canonical_terminology, executable_formulas)
  - `authority_proof_arsenal:` - Crucible story, authority statistics, proof stack templates
  - `objection_algorithms:` - 3+ algorithms for handling objections

### Research Sources Priority

1. **Minds (if available):** `outputs/minds/{slug}/` - Use analysis/, synthesis/, system_prompts/
2. **WebSearch:** For frameworks, quotes, biography
3. **Context7:** For library documentation if indexed
4. **WebFetch:** For specific pages (archives, blog posts)
5. **NO EXA:** Not configured

### Code Conventions

- Filenames: kebab-case (e.g., `dan-kennedy.md`)
- Copywriter files: `{firstname}-{lastname}.md`
- Agent file location: `expansion-packs/copywriter-os/agents/`

### Testing Patterns

- **Line Count:** No minimum but aim for Hormozi-level depth
- **Activation Test:** Agent must respond with @{agent-name}
- **Voice Consistency:** Output must match copywriter's documented style
- **Hormozi Comparison:** Check all required sections present

### Common Gotchas

- (Will be populated as Ralph learns)

## Quality Gates Status

> Check each gate as it passes. Story not complete until ALL pass.

### Pre-Implementation
- [x] PRD approved
- [x] prd.json created
- [x] progress.txt created

### Per-Story (Update each iteration)
- [ ] All required sections present (per Hormozi standard)
- [ ] Agent activates correctly
- [ ] Output matches copywriter style
- [ ] Comparison with Hormozi passes

### Documentation
- [ ] All 11 agents upgraded
- [ ] Activation tested for each

## 2026-01-17 - Project Setup

**Status:** ✅ Complete

### What was created
- PRD document: prd-agent-upgrade.md
- User stories: prd.json with 11 stories
- Progress tracking: progress.txt (this file)

### Research Sources Identified
- 4 minds available: dan_kennedy, eugene_schwartz, gary_halbert, jon_benson
- 7 agents require web research only

### Priority Order
1. **Priority 1-4:** Agents WITH minds (can extract from existing data)
2. **Priority 5-6:** Partially complete agents (Bencivenga, Sugarman)
3. **Priority 7-11:** Agents needing full web research

### Notes
Ready to start US-001 (Dan Kennedy) in next iteration.
