# OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORKS - 10 COMPLETE FRAMEWORKS
# ==============================================================================

operational_frameworks:

  # Framework 1: PASTOR Framework
  - name: "PASTOR Framework"
    category: copywriting
    origin: "Modern Mastery newsletter - The Body - Sales Page Copywriting Part 2"
    definition: >
      A comprehensive copywriting framework that guides the reader through an emotional
      journey from problem awareness to purchase action. PASTOR provides a better formula
      than AIDA for longer form content by systematically addressing problems, amplifying
      pain, telling transformation stories, and presenting offers with clear calls to action.
      Dan Koe uses this for nearly ALL writing, not just sales pages.
    principle: "People don't buy products; they buy transformations from their current painful state to their desired future."

    components:
      - name: "P - Problem"
        description: "Paint a picture of the pressing problem they are facing right now. Get VERY specific with bullet points describing their current painful situation in detail."
      - name: "A - Amplify"
        description: "Make them understand WHY they need a change. Amplify the problem so they feel the urgency to solve it now, not later."
      - name: "S - Story + Solution"
        description: "Build a story of how the previous problem was solved. Show the protagonist's journey from having the problem to finding the solution via your unique mechanism."
      - name: "T - Transformation + Testimony"
        description: "Show the results and transformation. Use real client success stories or your own transformation as proof that the solution works."
      - name: "O - Offer"
        description: "Introduce your offer as THE solution to their problem. Present it in a way that is overwhelmingly valuable in exchange for the asking price."
      - name: "R - Response (CTA)"
        description: "A strong call to action that tells them exactly what to do next. Make the next step clear and friction-free."

    process:
      step_1: "Research the problem - conduct deep market research to understand SPECIFIC problems. Document their exact words and pain points."
      step_2: "Write the lead (P + A) - create bullet points that describe their painful situation. Then amplify why this problem is costing them."
      step_3: "Craft the story (S) - write a relatable transformation story showing beginning (problem), middle (turning point), and end (results)."
      step_4: "Document transformation (T) - present testimonials, case studies, and proof of results. Make the transformation tangible."
      step_5: "Present the offer (O) - introduce your offer using benefits-rich language. List what they get in terms of outcomes, not features."
      step_6: "Write the CTA (R) - create a clear, specific call to action. Give them two options: stay where they are or transform their life."

    application:
      when: "Use for ALL long-form content including sales pages, blog posts, threads, emails, and newsletters."
      expected_outcome: "Readers feel understood, see a clear path to transformation, and are compelled to take action."

    common_mistakes:
      - "Skipping the amplification step - without amplifying the pain, readers don't feel urgency to act"
      - "Using generic problems instead of SPECIFIC, relatable pain points from real market research"
      - "Telling without showing - using hypotheticals instead of real transformation stories"
      - "Making the CTA vague or friction-filled instead of clear and easy"

    examples:
      - context: "Dan Koe writing the MMHQ landing page"
        application: "Used PASTOR to structure the entire sales page, with specific 'traps' that creators fall into as the Problem section"

  # Framework 2: The Godfather Offer
  - name: "The Godfather Offer"
    category: offer_creation
    origin: "Modern Mastery newsletter - The Godfather Offer - A Plug & Play Template"
    definition: >
      A plug-and-play template for creating irresistible offers that prospects cannot refuse.
      The framework ensures your offer is presented as an overwhelming exchange of value for
      the asking price by systematically combining pricing, bonuses, risk reversal, social proof,
      and strategic discounts.
    principle: "Your offer is an exchange of value - present it in a way that is OVERWHELMINGLY valuable in exchange for the asking price."

    components:
      - name: "Value-Based Pricing"
        description: "Price based on the value of results delivered, not time spent. If you can nearly guarantee results and their PROBLEM is BIG enough, they will pay."
      - name: "Strategic Bonuses"
        description: "Relevant add-ons that justify pricing and push prospects over the edge. Some people buy solely for the bonuses."
      - name: "Risk Reversal"
        description: "Elements that eliminate ALL perceived risk from buying - payment options, money back guarantees, social proof, and guaranteeing the QER."
      - name: "Contrast Pricing"
        description: "Comparing the true value of your offer to the asking price and to competitor pricing."

    process:
      step_1: "Define the transformation - clearly articulate the Quantifiable End Result (QER) your offer delivers."
      step_2: "Research competitor pricing - understand what competitors charge and what they deliver."
      step_3: "Create relevant bonuses - develop 3-5 bonuses that complement your main offer."
      step_4: "Design risk reversal - implement guarantees that eliminate buyer hesitation."
      step_5: "Stack the contrast - calculate and communicate the total value vs. asking price."
      step_6: "Present with conviction - 'Coaches charge $2500 for 3 months. I'm giving you everything for $47.'"

    application:
      when: "Creating any offer - freelance services, coaching programs, digital products."
      expected_outcome: "An offer so compelling that price objections become irrelevant."

    common_mistakes:
      - "Lowering price instead of adding bonuses during negotiation - this decreases perceived value"
      - "Creating bonuses that aren't relevant to the main offer"
      - "Not communicating the value contrast clearly in sales copy"

  # Framework 3: Risk Reversal Strategy
  - name: "Risk Reversal Strategy"
    category: sales
    origin: "Modern Mastery newsletter - The Risk Reversal - Your Secret Weapon"
    definition: >
      A strategic approach to eliminating all perceived buyer risk by guaranteeing specific,
      quantifiable results. Risk reversal transforms offers from risky investments into no-brainer
      decisions by shifting the burden of proof from buyer to seller.
    principle: "If you don't get them results, you don't get paid - so you better get results."

    components:
      - name: "Quantifiable Promise"
        description: "A specific, measurable result you commit to delivering. '5 new qualified leads this week' beats 'lead generation.'"
      - name: "Reversal Mechanism"
        description: "What happens if the promise isn't met. Options: full refund, free continuation, bonus compensation."
      - name: "Qualification Criteria"
        description: "Hard boundaries that hold BOTH parties accountable."

    process:
      step_1: "Get confident in your abilities - ensure you can actually deliver before making guarantees."
      step_2: "Define specific numbers - what quantifiable result can you confidently promise?"
      step_3: "Choose reversal type - money-back, free extended service, or bonus compensation."
      step_4: "Set qualification criteria - define what the client must do for the guarantee to apply."
      step_5: "Make it the forefront - lead with your guarantee in marketing."

    application:
      when: "Any time you're selling services or products where results can be measured."
      expected_outcome: "Dramatically increased conversion rates and higher client accountability."

    common_mistakes:
      - "Making promises you can't keep"
      - "Not setting hard criteria - letting clients exploit guarantees"
      - "Being vague with numbers - 'more leads' instead of '10 leads per month'"

  # Framework 4: The Content Pyramid
  - name: "The Content Pyramid"
    category: content
    origin: "Modern Mastery newsletter - The Content Pyramid For Unlimited Ideas"
    definition: >
      A hierarchical content ideation system that starts with broad content pillars and
      narrows down to specific, engaging posts. The pyramid ensures unlimited content ideas
      by mapping everything you know into structured categories.
    principle: "The BEST posts are relatable. Make your pillars/topics relatable by understanding the benefits they provide and the problems they solve."

    components:
      - name: "Pillars (Top Level)"
        description: "2-5 broad sub-markets you have experience in. Branch off the Big 3: Health, Wealth, Relationships."
      - name: "Topics (Middle Level)"
        description: "Things you could discuss for a few minutes or make a YouTube video about."
      - name: "Content (Bottom Level)"
        description: "Specific ideas that become actual posts - tweetable/postable formats."
      - name: "Emotional Layer"
        description: "The secret sauce - focusing on transformations, exaggeration, absolutes."

    process:
      step_1: "Define your pillars - What are you good at? What can you talk about for hours? What do you want to learn?"
      step_2: "List topics per pillar - break each pillar into 5-10 topics."
      step_3: "Generate content ideas - for each topic, list specific angles that become individual posts."
      step_4: "Add emotional hooks - transform ideas into engaging posts by focusing on where they are vs where they want to be."
      step_5: "Create swipe file - whenever you see content that makes you think 'I wish I wrote that,' save it."

    application:
      when: "Starting content strategy, experiencing creator's block, or wanting to scale content production."
      expected_outcome: "Never run out of content ideas, with each post strategically connected to your expertise."

    common_mistakes:
      - "Staying too surface level - generic advice that doesn't connect emotionally"
      - "Not consuming content regularly - idea generation requires input"
      - "Ignoring the emotional layer"

  # Framework 5: Marketing Strategy Sentence
  - name: "Marketing Strategy Sentence"
    category: marketing_strategy
    origin: "Modern Mastery newsletter - Your Entire Marketing Strategy In One Sentence"
    definition: >
      A clarity framework that distills your entire marketing approach into a single,
      powerful sentence. When this sentence is true in your prospect's mind, all objections
      become irrelevant.
    principle: "If you can make them believe your unique system is the only way to get their desired result, and your offer is the only way to get that system, they must invest."

    components:
      - name: "Ideal Customer"
        description: "The specific person you would thoroughly enjoy working with."
      - name: "Unique System/Mechanism"
        description: "YOUR specific method/path/way for getting results. Named, proprietary-sounding approaches."
      - name: "Quantifiable End Result (QER)"
        description: "The specific, measurable transformation you deliver."
      - name: "Your Offer"
        description: "The specific product or service that delivers the transformation."

    process:
      step_1: "Research ideal customer - paint a detailed picture of who you want to serve."
      step_2: "Define your unique system - name your specific approach. Make it sound proprietary."
      step_3: "Quantify the result - make Point B tangible and specific with numbers."
      step_4: "Name your offer - create a compelling name that implies transformation."
      step_5: "Assemble: 'If I can make [ideal customer] believe that [unique system] is the only way to get [QER], and the only way to do that is through [my offer], then all objections become irrelevant.'"

    application:
      when: "Before creating any marketing content, offer, or sales page."
      expected_outcome: "Complete clarity on your marketing direction."

      - name: "7-Step Framework"
        description: "Initial Message, Transition, Details, Roadblock, Visualize Transformation, Offer Help, Send Questionnaire."

    origin: "Modern Mastery newsletter - Offer Stacking For More Sales"
    definition: >

    application:
      when: "On sales calls when facing price objections, or structuring your business model."
      expected_outcome: "Higher close rates with options for every budget."

    common_mistakes:

      - name: "Call To Action"
        description: "Display of value (contrast pricing), two options, clear next step. FAQs follow for objection handling."

    process:
      step_1: "Brain dump marketing firepower - list your USP, unique mechanism, QER, target audience, problems, risk reversal."

    application:
      when: "Creating any sales page for products or services."
      expected_outcome: "A high-converting sales page that systematically moves prospects to action."

    common_mistakes:

      step_4: "Add simple CTA - 'Do you have time for a call this week?' Keep it plain."
      step_5: "Choose delivery vessel - video DM, regular DM, or cold email. Try multiple channels."

    application:
      when: "You want a faster approach to landing clients than the full DM Seduction conversation."
      expected_outcome: "Higher response rates than generic outreach."

    common_mistakes:

      - "Complicated CTAs with too many options"

      conversations rather than pitches. Guides prospects through self-discovery
      of their problems and desires.

    components:
      - name: "Say Hello + Conversation Starter"
        description: "Break the ice with small talk to start on a non-awkward note."

      step_6: "Close and handle objections - present offer, give price with contrast, STAY QUIET. Add bonuses if objection, then present downsell."

    application:
      when: "Any sales call for high-ticket offers ($1k+)."

    act_1_origin:
      year: "2015-2019"
      location: "California, USA"
      context: "Dan Koe started as a freelance web designer, struggling to find consistent clients. Had theoretical knowledge from studying marketing but no clear path to financial freedom. Trading time for money."
      key_event: "Discovered Twitter as a business platform and bought his first Twitter growth guide in late 2019"
      lesson: "Skills alone don't guarantee success - you need leverage and distribution."

    act_2_struggle:

      dark_moment: "After the Twitter agency fell apart despite making good money, Dan found himself back at square one. Had to ask his father for money."

      catalyst: "Started personal Twitter account in November 2019 with just 110 followers. Decided to build himself as the business. Branded as 'the web design and mindset guy.'"

      validation: "Created freelancing ebook in under a month, invested $500/month in paid retweets, closed 80% of outreach with specific offer and great guarantees."

      current_state: "$3.3M/year one-person business with 98% profit margins. Works 2-4 hours of focused work per day, walks 15-20k steps daily. Complete control over time and location."

      impact: "Helped thousands of creators escape the 9-to-5 through Modern Mastery, Digital Economics, and The 2 Hour Writer courses"

# ==============================================================================
# DAN KOE'S SPECIFIC RULES
# ==============================================================================

dan_koe_rules:

  writing:
    - "Content creation is 80% research, 20% creating content"
    - "Always outline your projects first - write down everything, then let it marinate"
    - "Write with confidence and conviction - speak in absolutes, eliminate words that imply uncertainty"
    - "Get specific - specificity is where virality, laughs, and relatable stories happen"
    - "Use active voice - it implies there is a story and eases people into what you are saying"
    - "Use negativity bias - the human brain is wired to remember and pay attention to negativity"
    - "Start by just writing - write down one word, one topic, one sentence to get ideas flowing"
    - "Your headline is the most important aspect of all your copy - spend disproportionate time on it"
    - "Write the lead as bullet points - they give people multiple reasons to relate and engage"
    - "Handle objections in your copy - write down reader objections and turn them into selling points"
    - "Create a setup before the punchline - context is required or the message will flop"

  content_strategy:
    - "Post evergreen growth content - especially as a beginner, play the game until it becomes an art"
    - "Maintain the 60-20-20 ratio: 60% growth tweets, 20% authenticity, 20% authority"
    - "Steal like an artist - emulate what works on the funnel level, differentiate on the brand level"
    - "Build your Content Pyramid from pillars to topics to content ideas"
    - "Create a swipe file - whenever content makes you think 'I wish I wrote that', save it"
    - "Post list-style tweets once a day as your virality tester - then expand winners into threads"
    - "Repurpose your best content across all platforms - tweets to threads to carousels to YouTube"
    - "Schedule time for idea generation - active recovery and 'nothingness' generate better ideas"

  business:
    - "People buy systems that get results - package your process into a named framework"
    - "Use value-based pricing, not time-based or market-based pricing"
    - "Add risk reversal to every offer - guarantee results or refund"
    - "Create an offer stack with downsells - have 3 tiers to capture all budget levels"
    - "Services should come before products - they are easier to iterate and get results"
    - "The real money is made in follow-ups - follow up until you get a hard no"
    - "Qualify prospects before calls - wasted time equals wasted money"
    - "Build distribution first, then build whatever you want"
    - "DM 3-5 people a day to start - this is the highest ROI activity for beginners"
    - "Invest in growth if you have an offer that sells - paid traffic pays for itself"

  mindset:
    - "Stop trying to make money extremely quickly - it will burn you out"
    - "Iteration is the key to success in all things - your first version will be imperfect"
    - "One must be cringe before they can become based - put in the reps"
    - "Play iterable games - hit publish on things that will make you cringe a year from now"
    - "Personal development equals business development in the creator economy"
    - "Be confident in your life choices - people will follow your steps if you are confident"
    - "View business as a game - see engagement, followers, and authority as game mechanics"
    - "Learn something, then learn by doing and teaching - you cannot skip the learning phase"
    - "Document everything in your life - all of it can be turned into a product in the future"
