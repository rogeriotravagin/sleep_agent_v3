# Copy Framework - Archive

## Purpose

This directory contains agents that were part of the Copy expansion pack but are **not direct response copywriters**.

These agents are preserved here for:
1. **Historical reference** - They may contain useful frameworks
2. **Potential reactivation** - If needed for specific projects
3. **Cross-pollination** - Their methodologies may inform other work

## Archived Agents

| Agent | Reason for Archive |
|-------|-------------------|
| `alex-hormozi.md` | Business strategist, not a copywriter by trade |
| `dan-koe.md` | Content creator/educator, not direct response specialist |
| `frank-kern.md` | Marketing strategist, known for launches not copy |
| `ramit-sethi.md` | Personal finance educator, not a copywriter |

## Framework v2.0 Focus

The Copy Framework v2.0 focuses exclusively on **direct response copywriters** with documented:
- Track records ($100M+ in sales attributed to their copy)
- Published works on copywriting methodology
- Reproducible frameworks for writing copy

## Reactivation

To reactivate an archived agent:
1. Move from `archive/agents/` to `agents/`
2. Update `config.yaml` to include agent
3. Update `copy-chief.md` to include in team roster
