## CORE PHILOSOPHY

> "Don't tell them - make them FEEL it. Cerebral copy informs. Visceral copy TRANSFORMS."
> — Clayton Makepeace

Visceral copy is copy that bypasses the logical, analytical mind and strikes directly at the emotional core. It doesn't just describe benefits - it makes readers EXPERIENCE them. It doesn't just explain problems - it makes readers FEEL them in their bones.

### The Fundamental Difference

**Cerebral Copy (WEAK):**
- Appeals to logic and reason
- States facts and features
- Describes benefits abstractly
- Explains the problem intellectually
- Asks readers to "understand"

**Visceral Copy (STRONG):**
- Appeals to gut instinct and emotion
- Creates sensory experiences
- Paints benefits vividly
- Makes readers FEEL the problem
- Forces readers to "experience"

---

## PHASE 1: EMOTION DISCOVERY & ANALYSIS

### Step 1.1: Identify the Dominant Resident Emotion (DRE)

Before transforming any copy, you must identify the pre-existing emotional state your target audience brings to your message.

**The 16 Dominant Emotions (Clayton Makepeace):**

| # | Emotion | Definition | Best For |
|---|---------|------------|----------|
| 1 | GREED | Desire for more wealth/success | Financial, business opportunity |
| 2 | FEAR | Anticipation of loss/danger/pain | Health, security, insurance |
| 3 | VANITY | Desire to look good/be admired | Beauty, fashion, fitness |
| 4 | LOVE | Desire to protect/nurture loved ones | Family, insurance, health |
| 5 | PRIDE | Desire for achievement/recognition | Education, professional development |
| 6 | LUST | Desire for pleasure/gratification | Luxury, food, travel, entertainment |
| 7 | REVENGE | Desire to prove doubters wrong | Self-improvement, business success |
| 8 | ANGER | Frustration at injustice | Consumer advocacy, competitive positioning |
| 9 | GUILT | Weight of unmet obligations | Family products, charitable giving |
| 10 | HOPE | Belief things can get better | Health solutions, career change |
| 11 | ENVY | Desire to have what others have | Exclusive offers, insider information |
| 12 | LAZINESS | Desire for ease/shortcuts | Automation, done-for-you solutions |
| 13 | EMBARRASSMENT | Fear of looking foolish | Personal improvement, education |
| 14 | EXCLUSIVITY | Desire to be part of elite group | Premium products, memberships |
| 15 | CURIOSITY | Need to know/solve mystery | Information products, all headlines |
| 16 | FRUSTRATION | Exhaustion from repeated failure | New approaches, breakthrough solutions |

**DRE Discovery Process:**

```
1. RESEARCH: Customer complaints, forum discussions, reviews
2. IDENTIFY: Which 1-2 emotions dominate?
3. VALIDATE: Does your copy acknowledge these emotions?
4. AMPLIFY: Does your copy intensify these emotions?
5. CHANNEL: Does your copy direct emotions toward your solution?
```

**DRE Discovery Worksheet:**

```markdown
## Dominant Resident Emotion Analysis

### Target Audience
- Who: [Specific description]
- Problem they face: [Their words, not yours]
- What they've tried: [Previous failed solutions]
- How they feel: [Emotional state]

### Primary DRE
- Emotion: [Name from 16 emotions]
- Evidence: [How you identified this]
- Intensity: [1-10 scale]
- Trigger words they use: [List their language]

### Secondary DRE
- Emotion: [Name]
- Relationship to primary: [How they connect]

### Emotional Sequence
1. Enter on: [Initial emotion to match]
2. Amplify to: [Intensified version]
3. Shift to: [Emotion that drives action]
4. Resolve with: [Relief emotion after purchase]
```

### Step 1.2: Audit Existing Copy for Emotional Resonance

**The Cerebral vs Visceral Test:**

For each section of the existing copy, ask:

| Question | If YES = Visceral | If NO = Cerebral |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|
| Does it create a physical response? | ✓ | Transform |
| Can the reader SEE what's described? | ✓ | Transform |
| Does it use sensory language? | ✓ | Transform |
| Does it acknowledge their emotion? | ✓ | Transform |
| Does it intensify the feeling? | ✓ | Transform |
| Does it paint a vivid future? | ✓ | Transform |

**Emotional Resonance Scoring:**

Score each section of copy:
- **0-2:** Pure information, no emotion
- **3-4:** Some emotional acknowledgment
- **5-6:** Moderate emotional engagement
- **7-8:** Strong emotional connection
- **9-10:** Visceral, gut-punching impact

**Goal:** Transform all sections to 7+ score.

---

## PHASE 2: SENSORY LANGUAGE TRANSFORMATION

### Step 2.1: The Five Senses Audit

Every piece of copy should engage multiple senses. Audit and enhance:

**VISUAL (See):**
```
Weak: "You'll be successful."
Strong: "Picture yourself pulling into your driveway in a brand-new Mercedes...
your neighbors watching through their blinds... wondering what you're doing
that they're not."
```

Trigger words: picture, imagine, see, watch, notice, witness, vivid, crystal clear, visible, stark, brilliant

**AUDITORY (Hear):**
```
Weak: "Your heart is working hard."
Strong: "Hear your heart pounding in your ears... that relentless drumbeat
that keeps you awake at 3am wondering if tonight's the night it gives out."
```

Trigger words: hear, listen, whisper, roar, thundering, silent, deafening, resonating, echoing, ringing

**KINESTHETIC (Feel):**
```
Weak: "You'll have more energy."
Strong: "Feel the surge of clean energy flooding through your body...
that electric aliveness you haven't experienced since your twenties."
```

Trigger words: feel, touch, grip, surge, flood, rush, pulse, throb, sting, burn, ache, melt

**OLFACTORY (Smell):**
```
Weak: "The car is high quality."
Strong: "Breathe in that new-car smell as you settle into butter-soft
leather... the scent of success."
```

Trigger words: smell, scent, aroma, fragrance, breathe, whiff, pungent, fresh

**GUSTATORY (Taste):**
```
Weak: "Victory is possible."
Strong: "Taste the victory as you finally prove everyone wrong."
```

Trigger words: taste, savor, devour, feast, bitter, sweet, delicious, mouthwatering

### Step 2.2: Sensory Enhancement Matrix

For each major benefit or pain point, fill in:

```markdown
## Sensory Enhancement Matrix

### [Benefit/Pain Point]

| Sense | Original | Enhanced |
|-------|----------|----------|
| See | [blank or weak] | [vivid visual] |
| Hear | [blank or weak] | [auditory detail] |
| Feel | [blank or weak] | [kinesthetic description] |
| Smell | [if applicable] | [olfactory detail] |
| Taste | [if applicable] | [gustatory metaphor] |

### Combined Sensory Description:
[Weave 3+ senses into one powerful paragraph]
```

### Step 2.3: Power Verb Transformation

**Weak Verbs → Power Verbs:**

| Weak | → | Power Alternatives |
|------|---|-------------------|
| help | → | transform, revolutionize, unleash, ignite |
| improve | → | supercharge, amplify, skyrocket, explode |
| reduce | → | crush, eliminate, obliterate, demolish |
| get | → | seize, capture, claim, unlock |
| have | → | command, possess, wield, own |
| make | → | forge, create, craft, build |
| give | → | unleash, deliver, inject, flood |
| show | → | reveal, expose, uncover, unmask |
| use | → | deploy, leverage, harness, activate |
| change | → | transform, revolutionize, disrupt, reinvent |

**Transformation Rule:**
Every paragraph should contain at least 2 power verbs.

---

## PHASE 3: PAIN AGITATION TRANSFORMATION

### Step 3.1: The Pain Agitation Sequence

Clayton Makepeace taught that you must make the problem unbearable before offering the solution. This 6-step sequence creates that intensity:

**Step 1: NAME the Pain**
State the problem in their EXACT words (from research).

```
Example:
"You've tried everything. The diets. The exercise programs.
The pills that promised miracles and delivered disappointment."
```

**Step 2: VALIDATE the Pain**
Show you understand their frustration completely.

```
Example:
"And every single time, it's the same devastating story. You lose
the weight... then watch helplessly as it comes back. With friends."
```

**Step 3: EXPAND the Pain**
Show ALL the ways this problem poisons their life.

```
Example:
"It's not just about the number on the scale anymore, is it? It's about
dreading mirrors. Avoiding photos. Making excuses to skip the beach.
Wondering - in your darkest moments - if your spouse still finds you
attractive. If you still find yourself attractive."
```

**Step 4: PROJECT the Pain**
Paint the future if NOTHING changes.

```
Example:
"And here's the brutal truth nobody wants to tell you: If nothing changes
in the next 90 days, you'll be 10 pounds heavier this time next year.
Your knees will hurt more. Your energy will be lower. And you'll look
back at TODAY - at this very moment - as the 'good old days.'"
```

**Step 5: REVEAL the Real Enemy**
Shift blame externally - it's NOT their fault.

```
Example:
"But here's what they never told you... It's NOT your willpower. It's NOT
your genetics. It's NOT that you're weak or lazy or destined to be
overweight. It's a metabolic switch deep in your cells that got stuck
in the 'OFF' position the day you turned 35."
```

**Step 6: OFFER Hope**
NOW - and only now - introduce the solution.

```
Example:
"What if you could flip that switch back ON? What if your body could
start burning fat the way it did when you were 25 - automatically,
effortlessly, 24 hours a day?"
```

### Step 3.2: Pain Agitation Template

```markdown
## Pain Agitation Sequence

### 1. NAME IT (1-2 sentences)
[State their problem in THEIR words]

### 2. VALIDATE IT (2-3 sentences)
[Show you understand their frustration completely]

### 3. EXPAND IT (3-5 sentences)
[Show all the ways it affects their life: health, relationships,
self-esteem, career, future]

### 4. PROJECT IT (2-3 sentences)
[Paint the grim future if nothing changes]

### 5. REVEAL THE ENEMY (2-3 sentences)
[Shift blame to external factor - it's NOT their fault]

### 6. OFFER HOPE (2-3 sentences)
[Introduce the possibility of transformation]
```

### Step 3.3: Pain Intensity Amplifiers

Use these techniques to increase pain intensity:

**Time Compression:**
"Every DAY you wait, [negative consequence]."

**Accumulation:**
"And it's getting worse. Not better. WORSE."

**Comparison:**
"While others [enjoy benefit], you're [suffering consequence]."

**Social Impact:**
"Your [loved ones] notice. They don't say anything, but they notice."

**Lost Opportunity:**
"How many [opportunities] have you already missed because of this?"

---

## PHASE 4: BENEFIT DIMENSIONALIZATION

### Step 4.1: The Three Dimensions of Benefits

Clayton Makepeace (building on Tom Phillips) taught that benefits must be dimensionalized across three axes:

**Dimension 1: SENSORY**
What do they see, hear, feel, taste, smell?

**Dimension 2: SOCIAL**
How do others react? What do people notice? How does status change?

**Dimension 3: TEMPORAL**
What was BEFORE vs what is AFTER? How does time feel different?

### Step 4.2: The Dimensionalization Formula

```
FLAT BENEFIT → DIMENSIONALIZED BENEFIT

1. State the raw benefit (what)
2. Add sensory detail (how it feels)
3. Add social impact (how others react)
4. Add temporal contrast (before vs after)
5. Add personal meaning (what it means for their life)
```

**Example Transformation:**

**FLAT:** "You'll have more energy."

**DIMENSIONALIZED:**
"Feel the surge of clean, natural energy flooding your body at 6am -
before your first cup of coffee. [SENSORY] Notice how the brain fog
lifts. How colors seem brighter. How you actually WANT to get out of bed.

Watch your spouse's face when you suggest a walk after dinner - instead
of collapsing on the couch. See the surprise. The delight. The attraction
that rekindled. [SOCIAL]

Remember last month, when 3pm hit and you were already running on fumes?
Now imagine sailing through to 6pm with energy to spare - energy for
your kids, your hobbies, your LIFE. [TEMPORAL]

This isn't just about energy. It's about getting your life back. The
life that slipped away so gradually you didn't notice until it was gone."
[PERSONAL MEANING]

### Step 4.3: Dimensionalization Template

```markdown
## Benefit Dimensionalization Worksheet

### Raw Benefit
[Single statement of what they get]

### Sensory Dimension
- What do they SEE?
- What do they FEEL physically?
- What do they HEAR?
- [Any smell/taste if relevant]

Write it out:
[2-3 sentences]

### Social Dimension
- How does their spouse/partner react?
- What do friends/colleagues notice?
- How does their status change?
- What envy do they create?

Write it out:
[2-3 sentences]

### Temporal Dimension
- What was BEFORE like? (specific moment)
- What is AFTER like? (specific moment)
- What changes over time?

Write it out:
[2-3 sentences]

### Personal Meaning
- What does this MEAN for their life?
- What becomes possible?
- What weight is lifted?

Write it out:
[1-2 sentences]

### Combined Dimensionalized Benefit
[Weave all dimensions into one powerful paragraph]
```

## PHASE 5: FUTURE PACING TRANSFORMATION

### Step 5.1: What is Future Pacing?

Future pacing transports the reader FORWARD in time to experience the transformation as if it's already happened. They taste victory before spending a dime.

> "Make them taste the victory before they've spent a dime."
> — Clayton Makepeace

### Step 5.2: Future Pacing Structures

**Structure 1: The Time Transport**
```
"Picture yourself [timeframe] from now. You [specific scene with sensory
detail]. [What has changed]. [How it feels]. [What others notice]."
```

Example:
"Picture yourself 90 days from now. You step on the scale - and for the
first time in years, you actually SMILE at the number. You slide into
those jeans that have been mocking you from the back of your closet.
They fit. Actually, they're LOOSE. Your spouse walks by and does a
double-take. 'You look amazing,' they say. And for once, you believe it."

**Structure 2: The Moment of Victory**
```
"Imagine the moment when [specific achievement]. Feel [physical sensation].
See [visual detail]. Hear [what people say]."
```

Example:
"Imagine the moment when your doctor looks at your test results and says,
'Whatever you're doing, keep it up.' Feel the relief wash over you -
that weight you've been carrying for years finally lifting. See the
smile spreading across your face. Hear your spouse exhale the breath
they've been holding since your last checkup."

**Structure 3: The Contrast Revelation**
```
"Remember when [painful past moment]? Now imagine [transformed moment].
That's not a fantasy. That's your life [timeframe] from now."
```

Example:
"Remember last Thanksgiving, squeezing into a chair at the kids' table
because you were too embarrassed to sit at the main table? Now imagine
walking into THIS Thanksgiving dinner in clothes that fit perfectly,
feeling confident, actually WANTING to be photographed. That's not a
fantasy. That's your life 90 days from now."

### Step 5.3: Future Pacing Template

```markdown
## Future Pacing Sequence

### The Setup
Timeframe: [30/60/90 days, 6 months, 1 year]
Setting: [Specific situation relevant to their life]

### The Scene
"Picture yourself [timeframe] from now. You're [where/doing what]."

### The Sensory Details
- They see: [specific visual]
- They feel: [physical sensation]
- They hear: [dialogue or sounds]

### The Social Proof
- Others notice: [specific reactions]
- Relationships change: [how]

### The Internal Shift
- They realize: [insight]
- They feel: [emotional state]

### The Closing Line
"That's not a fantasy. That's [product name] at work."
```

---

## PHASE 6: HEADLINES & BULLETS TRANSFORMATION

### Step 6.1: Emotional Headline Formula

Headlines must grab the dominant emotion immediately. Use these patterns:

**Pattern 1: Problem + Promise**
```
"Finally... [Solution] for [Audience] Who [Have Struggled With Problem]"
Example: "Finally... A Weight Loss Solution for Women Over 40 Who've
Tried Everything and Failed"
```

**Pattern 2: Curiosity + Benefit**
```
"The [Adjective] Secret to [Desirable Outcome] That [Authority]
Doesn't Want You to Know"
Example: "The Shocking Secret to Pain-Free Joints That Big Pharma
Doesn't Want You to Know"
```

**Pattern 3: Time + Result**
```
"How to [Achieve Result] in [Timeframe] Without [Common Obstacle]"
Example: "How to Speak Conversational Spanish in 30 Days Without
Boring Grammar Drills or Expensive Classes"
```

**Pattern 4: Envy + Curiosity**
```
"What [Successful Group] Know About [Topic] That [Struggling Group] Don't"
Example: "What Millionaire Investors Know About the Stock Market That
Average Investors Will Never Figure Out"
```

### Step 6.2: Fascination Bullet Formulas (The 21 Types)

Transform flat bullets into fascinations using these formulas:

**1. The "How To" Bullet**
```
Flat: "Ways to save money"
Fascination: "How to slash your grocery bill by $200/month without
clipping a single coupon or giving up your favorite foods. Page 47."
```

**2. The "Secret To" Bullet**
```
Flat: "Sleep better"
Fascination: "The ancient Tibetan secret to falling asleep in under
3 minutes - even if your mind is racing with anxiety. Page 23."
```

**3. The "Why" Bullet**
```
Flat: "Diets fail"
Fascination: "Why 97% of diets fail within one year - and the simple
'switch' that puts you in the 3% who succeed. Page 15."
```

**4. The "What Never" Bullet**
```
Flat: "Foods to avoid"
Fascination: "What NEVER to eat for breakfast if you're over 50 - and
the 'healthy' food that's silently destroying your metabolism. Page 31."
```

**5. The "Warning" Bullet**
```
Flat: "Medication side effects"
Fascination: "WARNING: If you take this common blood pressure medication,
you MUST read page 67 before your next dose."
```

### Step 6.3: Bullet Power Amplifiers

Add these elements to increase bullet impact:

| Amplifier | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Specific numbers | "7 foods" vs "foods" |
| Timeframes | "in 14 days" vs "fast" |
| Page numbers | "Page 47" creates tangibility |
| Qualifiers | "even if you've tried everything" |
| Stakes | "before it's too late" |
| Contrast | "without drugs, diets, or exercise" |
| Authority | "that doctors don't tell you" |

---

## PHASE 8: BEFORE/AFTER EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Health/Supplement

**BEFORE (Cerebral):**
"Our supplement supports healthy cholesterol levels. Clinical studies show
it can help reduce LDL cholesterol. Take two capsules daily for best results."

**AFTER (Visceral):**
"Picture your arteries right now. Coated with sticky, yellow plaque.
Narrowing day by day. Your heart working harder and harder to force blood
through passages that keep getting smaller.

Now imagine those same arteries 90 days from now - walls smooth and clean.
Blood flowing freely. Your heart breathing a sigh of relief as the pressure
finally eases.

Feel that heaviness in your chest lift. Notice the energy returning -
the kind of energy you haven't felt in years. Watch your doctor's
eyebrows rise when she sees your new numbers.

'Whatever you're doing,' she says, 'keep doing it.'

That moment isn't a fantasy. It's what happens when you give your body
what it's been starving for."

### Example 2: Financial/Investment

**BEFORE (Cerebral):**
"Our trading system identifies market opportunities using technical analysis.
Average returns beat the S&P 500. Easy to use interface."

**AFTER (Visceral):**
"What would you do with an extra $4,387 in your account every month?

Picture yourself logging in tomorrow morning. Same coffee. Same kitchen
table. But something's different. Your account shows a number that makes
you do a double-take. You refresh the page. It's real.

That knot in your stomach - the one that tightens every time you think
about retirement - starts to loosen. For the first time in years, you
exhale completely.

Your spouse walks in. 'What's wrong?' they ask, noticing your expression.

'Nothing's wrong,' you say, turning the laptop toward them. 'Everything's
finally right.'

While others panic at every market dip, you smile. Because you know
something they don't. You've seen the signal. You know what's coming.
And you're positioned to profit from it."

### Example 3: Weight Loss

**BEFORE (Cerebral):**
"Our program helps you lose weight through balanced nutrition and exercise.
Average participant loses 15-20 pounds. No extreme dieting required."

**AFTER (Visceral):**
"You've tried everything. The diets that left you starving. The exercise
programs that left you exhausted. The pills that promised everything and
delivered nothing but a lighter wallet.

Every time, the same heartbreaking story. Lose 10 pounds. Gain back 15.
Watch hope drain away as the number on the scale creeps higher than
where you started.

It's not just about weight anymore, is it? It's about avoiding mirrors.
Dreading photos. Making excuses to skip the beach, the pool, the
backyard barbecue. It's about wondering - in your darkest moments -
if your spouse still sees you the way they used to.

But here's what nobody told you: It's NOT your fault.

Your willpower isn't broken. Your metabolism isn't 'slow.' There's a
switch inside your cells that got stuck in the OFF position years ago.
A switch that, when flipped back ON, tells your body to burn fat the
way it did when you were 25.

Picture yourself 90 days from now. Stepping on the scale and actually
smiling at what you see. Sliding into those jeans that have been
haunting you from the back of your closet. Catching your spouse
staring at you the way they used to.

That's not a fantasy. That's what happens when you finally flip the
switch."

---

## PHASE 9: COMMON TRANSFORMATION MISTAKES

### Mistake 1: Going Emotional Without Foundation

**Problem:** Jumping straight to emotion without establishing relevance.

**Fix:** Always NAME the problem first using their exact words, THEN intensify.

### Mistake 2: Vague Sensory Language

**Problem:** Using sensory words without specific details.

**Bad:** "Feel great"
**Good:** "Feel the surge of energy flooding through your body at 6am"

### Mistake 3: Forgetting Social Dimension

**Problem:** Focusing only on personal benefits, ignoring how others will react.

**Fix:** Always show how spouse, friends, colleagues, doctors will notice/react.

### Mistake 4: Weak Future Pacing

**Problem:** Generic future statements without concrete scenes.

**Bad:** "You'll be successful"
**Good:** "Picture yourself 90 days from now, pulling into your driveway
in a brand-new Tesla, your neighbor's jaw dropping as you step out..."

### Mistake 5: Insufficient Pain Agitation

**Problem:** Rushing to solution without making problem unbearable.

**Fix:** Use full 6-step pain agitation sequence. Make them DESPERATE for relief.

### Mistake 6: Flat Bullets

**Problem:** Bullets that inform but don't fascinate.

**Bad:** "How to save money on groceries"
**Good:** "The 3-second test that tells you EXACTLY which 'sale' items are
actually scams - and which ones could save you $200 this month. Page 47."

## CONCLUSION

Visceral copy isn't about manipulation - it's about CONNECTION. Your readers are already feeling something. They're already suffering. They're already hoping. Your job is to acknowledge those feelings, intensify them, and channel them toward a solution that genuinely helps.

Master this task and you'll transform every piece of copy you touch from forgettable information into unforgettable experience.
