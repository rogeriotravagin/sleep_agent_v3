# Create Big Marketing Idea - Todd Brown Framework

## Purpose

Develop a powerful Big Marketing Idea using Todd Brown's 5 Criteria Framework. This is a **standalone task** focused ONLY on the Big Idea - the central concept that makes your offer impossible to ignore. For complete mechanism development including Problem/Solution Mechanisms, use `create-unique-mechanism.md` instead.

## When to Use

- **After E1 research is complete** - You need deep understanding before Big Idea discovery
- **When repositioning a product** - Finding a fresh angle for existing offer
- **When copy feels generic** - No clear differentiating concept
- **When multiple messages compete** - Need single-minded focus
- **Before writing any copy** - Big Idea shapes everything else
- **Quick ideation sessions** - Generate and validate ideas faster than full mechanism development

## Todd Brown on Big Ideas

```
"The reason why we were able to grow so big and so fast is because we
realized early on that we are all really in the idea business.

We're in the business of developing and disseminating interesting,
compelling, unique, startling, fresh new ideas to the marketplace.

99 out of 100 times, the Big Idea comes from digging deep, not from
the superficial standard stuff."

— Todd Brown, Marketing Funnel Automation

"The number one problem of all weak copywriting is a lack of a single,
unifying big idea."

— Mark Ford (Michael Masterson), Agora Publishing

## Workflow

### Step 1: Preparation Check

Before creating a Big Idea, validate you have sufficient inputs:

```
PRE-WORK VALIDATION:

□ Do you have deep E1 research?
  - Avatar: Pains, desires, beliefs, language
  - Market: Size, trends, sophistication level
  - Competition: What they're saying, what they're missing

  If NO → Complete E1 Examine phase first

□ Do you know your Primary Promise?
  - Specific result you deliver
  - Measurable outcome (when possible)
  - Desirable to target avatar

  If NO → Define primary promise first

□ Have you identified unique differentiators?
  - What do you do differently?
  - What do others miss?
  - What can only YOU claim?

  If NO → Do competitive analysis first

⚠️ WARNING: Big Ideas rarely come from surface-level thinking.
   If you haven't done deep research, the Big Idea will be weak.
```

### Step 2: Big Idea Discovery

Generate potential Big Ideas using these excavation techniques:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
BIG IDEA EXCAVATION TECHNIQUES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TECHNIQUE 1: CONTRARIAN FLIP
─────────────────────────────
Ask: "What does everyone in my market believe that's WRONG?"

Process:
1. List 5 common beliefs in your market
2. Challenge each one - is it actually true?
3. If you can prove the opposite, you have a potential Big Idea

Example:
- Common belief: "Lose weight = eat less + exercise more"
- Contrarian: "The harder you diet, the more your body fights back"
- Big Idea: "What if the key to weight loss isn't willpower at all?"


TECHNIQUE 2: THE HIDDEN CAUSE
─────────────────────────────
Ask: "What's the REAL reason my prospects haven't succeeded?"

Process:
1. List all the common approaches that fail
2. Find the hidden factor they all ignore
3. Name that hidden factor
4. Position your solution as addressing it

Example:
- Common approaches: Diets, exercise, willpower programs
- Hidden factor: Hormonal dysregulation
- Big Idea: "The hidden hormone switch that controls whether you
  burn or store fat"


TECHNIQUE 3: REFRAME THE PROBLEM
─────────────────────────────────
Ask: "What if my prospect has been solving the WRONG problem?"

Process:
1. Define the problem as the market sees it
2. Redefine it from a different angle
3. Show how the new frame changes everything

Example:
- Market sees: "I need more leads"
- Reframe: "You don't have a lead problem, you have a conversion problem"
- Big Idea: "Why chasing more leads is the slowest path to growth"


TECHNIQUE 4: THE SECRET THEY DON'T KNOW
───────────────────────────────────────
Ask: "What insider knowledge do I have that my prospects lack?"

Process:
1. List what you know that most don't
2. Identify what would shock/surprise them
3. Package it as a revelation

Example:
- Insider knowledge: "Big pharma profits from treating, not curing"
- Big Idea: "The $130 billion reason you've never heard of this
  natural compound"


TECHNIQUE 5: TIMING/CONTEXT SHIFT
─────────────────────────────────
Ask: "Why is NOW the perfect moment for this solution?"

Process:
1. Identify recent changes (technology, economy, trends)
2. Connect your solution to the timing
3. Create urgency through context

Example:
- Recent change: AI making many jobs obsolete
- Big Idea: "The 3 skills that AI can't replace
  (and how to master them before it's too late)"


TECHNIQUE 6: IDENTITY ANGLE
───────────────────────────
Ask: "What does my ideal customer WANT to be?"

Process:
1. Define the identity they aspire to
2. Position your offer as the path to that identity
3. Frame it as who they become, not what they get

Example:
- Desired identity: "Smart investor who beats the market"
- Big Idea: "The unconventional strategy quiet millionaires use
  while everyone else follows the crowd"


GENERATE 5-10 POTENTIAL BIG IDEAS:

Using the techniques above, write out potential ideas:

1. (Contrarian): _________________________________________________
2. (Hidden Cause): _________________________________________________
3. (Reframe): _________________________________________________
4. (Secret): _________________________________________________
5. (Timing): _________________________________________________
6. (Identity): _________________________________________________
7. (Combination): _________________________________________________
```

### Step 3: The 5 Criteria Test

Test each potential Big Idea against the 5 criteria:

SCORING KEY:
- 5/5 = STRONG ✅ Proceed with confidence
- 4/5 = WORKABLE 🔄 Strengthen the weak criterion
- 3/5 or less = WEAK ❌ Go back and dig deeper
```

### Step 4: One-Sentence Test

The winning Big Idea must pass the one-sentence test:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE ONE-SENTENCE TEST
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PURPOSE: If you can't state your Big Idea in ONE clear sentence,
it's not focused enough.

TEMPLATE OPTIONS:

TEMPLATE A (Promise + Mechanism):
"[Audience] can now [achieve result] by [unique mechanism/approach],
even if [common obstacle they believe prevents them]."

Example:
"Entrepreneurs can now build 6-figure businesses by working just
4 hours a day, even if they have no prior business experience—
because the key isn't working harder, it's leveraging systems."


TEMPLATE B (Discovery/Secret):
"[New discovery/insight] reveals why [common approach fails] and
how [your approach] finally makes [desired result] possible."

Example:
"A Stanford sleep study reveals why counting sheep actually makes
insomnia worse, and how a simple 2-minute reset technique finally
makes falling asleep in under 10 minutes possible."


TEMPLATE C (Contrarian):
"Contrary to what you've been told about [topic], [contrarian insight]
is the real key to [achieving desired outcome]."

Example:
"Contrary to what you've been told about social media marketing,
posting LESS is the real key to getting more engagement and sales."


TEMPLATE D (Identity Shift):
"For [specific person] who [situation], [product/solution] is the
[category] that [unique benefit], because [unique mechanism/reason]."

Example:
"For busy professionals who want to get fit, StrongFast is the
workout program that builds muscle in just 20 minutes a day,
because it uses high-intensity metabolic conditioning instead of
endless hours of cardio."


WRITE YOUR ONE-SENTENCE BIG IDEA:

_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________

VALIDATION:
□ Can be stated in ONE sentence (no run-ons)
□ Includes the Primary Promise (what they get)
□ Has element of uniqueness (what's different)
□ Is Intellectually Interesting (fresh angle)
□ Is Emotionally Compelling (creates reaction)
□ Is Relevant (leads to purchase)
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

```
MISTAKE 1: TOO VAGUE
─────────────────────
❌ "Our method helps you lose weight faster"
✅ "The 'Metabolic Reset' approach that works WITH your body's
   survival instincts instead of against them"

WHY: Vague ideas pass through without stopping attention


MISTAKE 2: MULTIPLE IDEAS JAMMED TOGETHER
─────────────────────────────────────────
❌ "Lose weight AND build muscle AND boost energy AND improve sleep"
✅ "The single metabolic switch that controls whether you burn or store fat"

WHY: Multiple ideas = no idea. Pick ONE and commit.


MISTAKE 3: INTELLECTUALLY INTERESTING BUT NOT EMOTIONAL
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
❌ "Research shows compound X affects mitochondrial function"
✅ "The hidden reason your body fights AGAINST every diet you try
   (and the simple fix that makes losing weight almost effortless)"

WHY: People buy on emotion, justify with logic. Need both.


MISTAKE 4: EMOTIONAL BUT NOT DEFENSIBLE
───────────────────────────────────────
❌ "Revolutionary breakthrough melts fat overnight!"
✅ "The compound doctors have been prescribing for 40 years that
   most people have never heard of for weight loss"

WHY: Hype without proof destroys credibility


MISTAKE 5: NOT CONNECTED TO PURCHASE
────────────────────────────────────
❌ "Fascinating new research on sleep cycles"
✅ "Why everything you know about falling asleep is wrong—and the
   2-minute technique that fixes it tonight"

WHY: Education without motivation doesn't convert


MISTAKE 6: SURFACE-LEVEL THINKING
────────────────────────────────
❌ Generating ideas without deep E1 research
✅ Digging through E1 insights to find non-obvious connections

WHY: "99/100 times, the Big Idea comes from digging deep"
```

## Quick Reference

### Todd Brown's Core Insights

```
"Without a Big Idea, you're just another competitor making noise."

"We don't write a single word of copy until we nail the idea."

"The 'how' differentiates more than the 'what'."

"People don't want better, they want different.
Different IS perceived as better."

"The number one problem of all weak copywriting is a lack of
a single, unifying big idea."
```

### The 5 Criteria Checklist

```
□ Intellectually Interesting - "I never saw it that way"
□ Emotionally Compelling - Creates visceral reaction
□ Unique and Ownable - Only you can claim this
□ Single-Minded - ONE clear concept
□ Relevant - Connected to desired outcome
```

### Big Idea Formula

```
E-C (P-P + U-M) I-I

Emotionally Compelling (Primary Promise + Unique Mechanism)
Intellectually Interesting
```
