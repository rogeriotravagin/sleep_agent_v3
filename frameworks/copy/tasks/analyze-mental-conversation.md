# Analyze Mental Conversation - Collier Method

## Purpose

Identify the internal dialogue already taking place in your prospect's mind. This is the MANDATORY FIRST STEP before writing any copy, based on Robert Collier's foundational principle.

## When to Use

- **ALWAYS FIRST** - Before writing any copy
- Before creating headlines or hooks
- When copy feels disconnected from audience
- When entering a new market
- When existing copy isn't converting

## Collier's Principle

```
"The reader of your letter is not interested in you or your product.
He is interested only in himself, his problems, his hopes, his dreams.

You must enter the conversation ALREADY taking place in his mind."

— Robert Collier, The Robert Collier Letter Book (1931)
```

## Inputs

```yaml
required:
  - target_audience: Who you're writing to
  - product_service: What you're selling
  - context: Where/when they'll see this

optional:
  - customer_research: Interview notes, surveys, reviews
  - competitor_messages: What competitors are saying
  - market_trends: Current events affecting them
```

## The Mental Conversation Concept

```
EVERY PROSPECT IS HAVING AN INTERNAL DIALOGUE

Right now, your prospect is thinking about something.
They're worrying about a problem.
They're dreaming about a desire.
They're processing fears and hopes.

THIS is the conversation you must join.

Your copy doesn't START a conversation.
Your copy ENTERS an existing conversation.

The mistake: "Let me tell you about my product!"
The Collier way: "I know you've been wondering about X..."
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Research the Conversation

```
CONVERSATION DISCOVERY QUESTIONS:

1. WHAT PROBLEMS ARE THEY ACTIVELY THINKING ABOUT?
   □ What keeps them awake at night?
   □ What do they complain about?
   □ What frustrates them daily?
   □ What have they tried that didn't work?

2. WHAT DESIRES ARE OCCUPYING THEIR MIND?
   □ What do they daydream about?
   □ What would make their life significantly better?
   □ What do they secretly hope for?
   □ What transformation do they want?

3. WHAT FEARS ARE LURKING?
   □ What do they worry about?
   □ What worst-case scenarios do they imagine?
   □ What are they trying to avoid?
   □ What do they fear losing?

4. WHAT DECISIONS ARE THEY FACING?
   □ What choices are on their plate?
   □ What are they trying to figure out?
   □ What options are they weighing?
   □ What's holding them back from deciding?

5. WHAT HAVE THEY RECENTLY EXPERIENCED?
   □ What triggered their current state?
   □ What event made them aware of the problem?
   □ What failure or success preceded this moment?
   □ Why are they in the market NOW?
```

### Step 2: Source the Research

```
WHERE TO FIND THE CONVERSATION:

□ CUSTOMER INTERVIEWS
  - What were they thinking before buying?
  - What almost stopped them?
  - What were they worried about?

□ SALES CALL RECORDINGS
  - What questions do they ask first?
  - What objections do they raise?
  - What language do they use?

□ SUPPORT TICKETS / EMAILS
  - What do they complain about?
  - What do they thank you for?
  - What surprises them?

□ AMAZON REVIEWS (of competitors)
  - What problems do they mention?
  - What did they hope for vs get?
  - What language do they use?

□ ONLINE FORUMS / REDDIT / FACEBOOK GROUPS
  - What questions get asked repeatedly?
  - What advice do they give each other?
  - What frustrations are shared?

□ GOOGLE SEARCHES
  - What are they searching for?
  - What questions are they asking?
  - What problems are they trying to solve?

□ SOCIAL MEDIA COMMENTS
  - What do they respond to?
  - What do they share?
  - What do they argue about?
```

### Step 3: Document the Conversation

```
MENTAL CONVERSATION ANALYSIS

Target Audience: _______________
Date: _______________

THE INTERNAL DIALOGUE:

What they're thinking right now:
"_______________________________________________"

What they're worried about:
"_______________________________________________"

What they secretly hope:
"_______________________________________________"

What they're afraid of:
"_______________________________________________"

What decision they're facing:
"_______________________________________________"

What triggered this state:
"_______________________________________________"
```

### Step 4: Find the Entry Point

```
CONVERSATION ENTRY ANALYSIS:

Given the conversation above:

1. ACKNOWLEDGMENT
   How can I show I understand their state?
   Entry: "If you've been _______________..."

2. EMPATHY
   What would a friend who understands say first?
   Entry: "I know how it feels when _______________..."

3. QUESTION
   What question are they already asking themselves?
   Entry: "Have you ever wondered why _______________?"

4. OBSERVATION
   What situation are they in that I can describe?
   Entry: "You've probably noticed that _______________..."

5. STORY
   What story would they relate to immediately?
   Entry: "Last week, someone just like you _______________..."

CHOSEN ENTRY ANGLE: _______________
```

### Step 5: Validate the Entry

```
ENTRY VALIDATION CHECKLIST:

□ Does this feel like joining a conversation, not starting one?
□ Would the prospect think "Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking!"?
□ Does it acknowledge their current state before introducing solution?
□ Is it about THEM, not about me or my product?
□ Does it create immediate relevance?
□ Would a stranger reading this feel understood?

If any NO → revise entry angle
```

## Example Analysis

```
EXAMPLE: Selling productivity software to overwhelmed managers

THE CONVERSATION:
- Currently thinking: "There aren't enough hours in the day"
- Worried about: "I'm going to miss something important"
- Hoping for: "Some way to feel in control again"
- Afraid of: "Looking incompetent / getting fired"
- Deciding on: "Whether to work longer or find a better system"
- Triggered by: "Missing a deadline last week"

ENTRY LINE:
"If you've ever ended a workday feeling like you barely made a
dent in your to-do list... if you've ever worked through lunch
only to realize you forgot something important anyway... then
you know exactly what I'm about to describe."

WHY IT WORKS:
- Enters their existing frustration
- Shows understanding of their daily reality
- Makes them feel "yes, that's me!"
- Doesn't mention product yet
```

## Common Mistakes

```
MISTAKE 1: Starting with the product
❌ "Introducing TaskMaster Pro, the revolutionary..."
✅ "If you're drowning in tasks and feeling overwhelmed..."

MISTAKE 2: Assuming the conversation
❌ Writing based on what YOU think they care about
✅ Research what they ACTUALLY think about

MISTAKE 3: Generic openings
❌ "Dear Valued Customer" or "Are you looking for..."
✅ Specific acknowledgment of their specific situation

MISTAKE 4: Interrupting vs Entering
❌ Forcing attention with shock or hype
✅ Earning attention by showing understanding
