# Create Abandoned Cart Recovery Sequence

**Task ID:** create-abandoned-cart
**Version:** 2.0.0
**Category:** Email Marketing / Recovery
**Minimum Output:** 4-email sequence with subject line variations
**Primary Methodology:** Dan Kennedy 3-Letter Sequence + Cialdini Persuasion Principles
**Research Source:** docs/research/abandoned-cart-methodology-research.md

---

## Purpose

Create high-converting abandoned cart email sequences that recover lost revenue by addressing the psychological reasons people abandon carts—not just reminding them they forgot something.

**The Problem:** 70-73% of online shopping carts are abandoned globally. Most brands either:
1. Send no recovery emails at all
2. Send a single generic "you forgot something" email
3. Discount too early, training customers to abandon

**The Solution:** A strategic 4-email sequence based on direct response copywriting principles that:
- Captures high-intent buyers immediately (Email 1)
- Addresses objections with value and proof (Email 2)
- Overcomes price resistance with targeted incentives (Email 3)
- Closes respectfully with final urgency (Email 4)

---

## When to Use

### Primary Use Cases
- E-commerce checkout abandonment (cart page, checkout page, payment page)
- Course/digital product checkout abandonment
- SaaS trial signup abandonment
- High-ticket service inquiry abandonment
- Webinar/event registration abandonment

### Secondary Use Cases
- Browse abandonment (viewed product, didn't add to cart)
- Wishlist/save-for-later reactivation
- Incomplete form submissions
- Quote request abandonment

## Theoretical Foundation

### Why People Abandon Carts (Address These, Not Just Remind)

| Reason | % | What to Address in Copy |
|--------|---|------------------------|
| Unexpected costs | 48-55% | Be transparent, justify value |
| Just browsing | 34-37% | Build desire, create urgency |
| Comparison shopping | 15-25% | Differentiate, social proof |
| Checkout friction | 17-26% | Offer help, simplify |
| Payment concerns | 8-11% | Trust signals, security |
| Delivery issues | 16-22% | Clear shipping info |
| Distraction | 10-15% | Simple reminder |

**Key Insight:** Recovery copy must ADDRESS OBJECTIONS, not just repeat "buy now."

### Cialdini's 6 Principles for Cart Recovery

```yaml
reciprocity:
  definition: "People feel obligated to return favors"
  application: "Offer genuine help before asking for purchase"
  example: "Let me know if you have questions—I'm here to help"

scarcity:
  definition: "Limited availability increases perceived value"
  application: "Stock warnings, time-limited offers"
  example: "Only 3 left in your size"
  warning: "Use ONLY with real scarcity—fake urgency destroys trust"

authority:
  definition: "People defer to credible experts"
  application: "Expert endorsements, awards, media mentions"
  example: "As featured in Forbes..."

consistency:
  definition: "People want to act consistently with past behavior"
  application: "Reference their selection, previous purchases"
  example: "You have great taste—these are customer favorites"

liking:
  definition: "People buy from those they like"
  application: "Conversational tone, personal sender"
  example: "Hey [Name], just wanted to reach out personally..."

social_proof:
  definition: "People follow actions of others"
  application: "Reviews, testimonials, customer counts"
  example: "Join 50,000+ happy customers"
  impact: "37.5% conversion increase (Figleaves case study)"
```

### Loss Aversion (The Master Principle)

**Research (Kahneman & Tversky):** The pain of losing is ~2x more powerful than the pleasure of gaining.

```yaml
gain_framed_weak:
  - "Get 20% off today"
  - "Complete your purchase"
  - "Free shipping available"

loss_framed_strong:
  - "Don't miss your 20% savings"
  - "Don't let these items slip away"
  - "Your free shipping expires tonight"

usage_rule: "Apply loss aversion ONCE per sequence (Email 3 or 4) for maximum impact"
```

### Dan Kennedy's Multiple Exposure Principle

> "No matter how good the offer is, a single exposure will have minimal effect. Multiple repeated exposures will have a positive effect disproportionate to the number of exposures."

**Implication:** A 4-email sequence dramatically outperforms single emails:
- Emails 2-4 generate **50%+ of total recovery revenue**
- Most brands leave this money on the table

---

## The RECOVER Framework

Use this framework to structure each email:

```
R - REMIND them of what they left
E - EMPATHIZE with their hesitation
C - COUNTER objections proactively
O - OFFER compelling value
V - VALIDATE with social proof
E - ESTABLISH urgency (real)
R - REINFORCE the CTA
```

**Application by Email:**

| Email | Primary Focus | Secondary Focus |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| 1 | R (Remind) + E (Empathize) | C (Counter - support offer) |
| 2 | V (Validate) + C (Counter) | E (Empathize) |
| 3 | O (Offer) + E (Establish urgency) | V (Validate) |
| 4 | E (Establish final urgency) | R (Reinforce) |

## Workflow: Step-by-Step Execution

### Phase 1: Discovery & Analysis

#### Step 1.1: Gather Cart Information
```yaml
collect:
  - Product(s) in cart (name, price, image)
  - Cart total value
  - Abandonment point (cart page, checkout, payment)
  - Customer segment (new, returning, VIP)
  - Any available browsing history
```

#### Step 1.2: Identify Primary Objection
```yaml
abandonment_signals:
  cart_page:
    likely_objection: "Need more information or justification"
    copy_focus: "Benefits, education, value"

  checkout_page:
    likely_objection: "Price concern or comparison shopping"
    copy_focus: "Value justification, differentiation"

  shipping_section:
    likely_objection: "Shipping cost or time"
    copy_focus: "Free shipping, delivery speed"

  payment_page:
    likely_objection: "Trust/security or technical issue"
    copy_focus: "Security badges, support offer, alternative payment"

  after_coupon_field:
    likely_objection: "Looking for better deal"
    copy_focus: "Unique offer, value stacking"
```

#### Step 1.3: Segment the Customer
```yaml
segments:
  first_time:
    trust_level: "Low"
    messaging: "Build trust, emphasize guarantee"
    incentive_tolerance: "Higher discount acceptable"

  returning:
    trust_level: "Medium-High"
    messaging: "Leverage relationship, loyalty benefits"
    incentive_approach: "Points, exclusive access"

  vip_high_value:
    trust_level: "High"
    messaging: "Personal touch, white-glove service"
    incentive_approach: "Premium bonuses, early access"
```

#### Step 1.4: Define Incentive Strategy
```yaml
incentive_matrix:
  low_cart_new_customer:
    primary: "10-15% discount"
    alternative: "Free shipping"

  low_cart_returning:
    primary: "Loyalty points bonus"
    alternative: "Free gift"

  high_cart_new_customer:
    primary: "Free shipping + bonus"
    alternative: "Payment plan"

  high_cart_returning:
    primary: "Exclusive early access"
    alternative: "VIP upgrade"

  price_sensitive_exit:
    primary: "Payment plan option"
    alternative: "Smaller purchase suggestion"

  shipping_objection:
    primary: "Free shipping"
    alternative: "Free expedited upgrade"

rules:
  - "NO discount in Email 1 (preserve margins)"
  - "Introduce incentive in Email 3"
  - "Increase incentive slightly in Email 4 if needed"
  - "Never discount more than 20% (brand value)"
```

---

### Phase 2: Email Sequence Creation

#### Step 2.1: Define Timing Sequence

```yaml
standard_sequence:
  email_1: "30-60 minutes after abandonment"
  email_2: "24 hours after abandonment"
  email_3: "48-72 hours after abandonment"
  email_4: "5-7 days after abandonment"

high_ticket_adjustment:
  email_1: "1-2 hours after abandonment"
  email_2: "48 hours after abandonment"
  email_3: "5 days after abandonment"
  email_4: "10 days after abandonment"
  note: "More consultative, less pressure"

low_ticket_adjustment:
  email_1: "30 minutes after abandonment"
  email_2: "24 hours after abandonment"
  email_3: "48 hours after abandonment"
  email_4: "72 hours after abandonment"
  note: "More direct, faster cadence acceptable"
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Messaging Mistakes
```yaml
avoid:
  - "Generic 'you forgot something' without context"
  - "Desperate, needy tone"
  - "Only pushing sale, no value"
  - "Ignoring the actual objection"
  - "Fake scarcity ('only 2 left!' when unlimited)"

do_instead:
  - "Personalize with product and context"
  - "Service-oriented, helpful tone"
  - "Address objections, provide value"
  - "Use real scarcity only"
```

### Timing Mistakes
```yaml
avoid:
  - "Single email only (leaves 50%+ revenue)"
  - "Multiple emails same day"
  - "First email 24+ hours after abandonment"
  - "Back-to-back emails (feels spammy)"

do_instead:
  - "4-email sequence minimum"
  - "Proper spacing (hours, then days)"
  - "First email within 1 hour"
  - "24-48 hour minimum between emails 2-4"
```

### Strategic Mistakes
```yaml
avoid:
  - "Discounting in Email 1"
  - "Same message to all segments"
  - "Ignoring mobile experience"
  - "No A/B testing"
  - "No graceful exit option"

do_instead:
  - "Save incentives for Email 3+"
  - "Segment by customer type and cart value"
  - "Mobile-first design"
  - "Test everything systematically"
  - "Always offer opt-out path"
```

## Advanced Tactics

### Multi-Channel Recovery
```yaml
email_plus_sms:
  email_1: "1 hour - Reminder"
  sms_1: "4 hours - 'Still interested? [link]'"
  email_2: "24 hours - Value + proof"
  email_3: "48 hours - Incentive"
  sms_2: "72 hours - 'Last chance: [code]'"
  email_4: "7 days - Final"

compliance:
  - "US SMS requires explicit opt-in"
  - "Max 1 SMS per 48 hours"
  - "Include opt-out in every SMS"
```

### Dynamic Content Personalization
```yaml
dynamic_blocks:
  - "Customer first name"
  - "Product name and image"
  - "Cart value"
  - "Personalized discount code"
  - "Location-based shipping estimate"
  - "Browsing history recommendations"
```

### Behavioral Triggers
```yaml
advanced_triggers:
  price_drop_on_carted_item:
    message: "Good news! [Product] is now [new price]"
    timing: "Immediate when price drops"

  back_in_stock:
    message: "[Product] is back in stock!"
    timing: "Immediate when restocked"

  low_stock_warning:
    message: "Only [X] left in your size"
    timing: "When inventory drops below threshold"
```
