## Purpose

Generate comprehensive sales closing scripts using methodologies from the world's top closers. This task creates complete call frameworks that handle discovery, presentation, objection handling, and closing sequences for any sales context.

**Key Principle:** "People buy emotionally and justify intellectually" (Sandler). Every script must address both the emotional pain and logical justification.

## Foundational Frameworks

### Framework 1: The CLOSER Framework (Hormozi)

The CLOSER framework creates a systematic conversation flow:

```
C - CLARIFY why they're there
    "What made you book this call today?"
    "What's happening that made this a priority?"

L - LABEL them with a problem
    "So it sounds like you're dealing with [problem]. Is that accurate?"

O - OVERVIEW their past experiences
    "What have you tried before?"
    "Why do you think those didn't work?"

S - SELL the vacation (outcome)
    "In a perfect world, what would [solved] look like?"
    "What would that mean for you?"

E - EXPLAIN away their concerns
    "What questions do you have?"
    "What would need to be true for you to feel confident?"

R - REINFORCE their decision
    "You made a great decision. Here's why..."
    "Your first step is [action]."
```

### Framework 2: The Pain Funnel (Sandler)

Systematically moves from surface symptoms to deep emotional pain:

```
LEVEL 1: IDENTIFY
"Tell me about your [situation]..."

LEVEL 2: EXPAND
"Tell me more about that..."
"Can you be more specific?"
"Give me an example..."

LEVEL 3: QUANTIFY
"How long has this been going on?"
"How much is this costing you?"
"What's the impact?"

LEVEL 4: EMOTIONALIZE
"How do you feel about that?"
"What's that doing to you personally?"

LEVEL 5: URGENCY
"What have you tried?"
"Did that work?"
"Have you given up trying to solve this?"

LEVEL 6: COMMITMENT
"If you could solve this, what would that mean?"
"How important is it... scale of 1-10?"
```

### Framework 3: SPIN Selling (Rackham)

Research-based questioning for complex sales:

```
S - SITUATION Questions
    Facts about current state
    "Tell me about your current [process]..."

P - PROBLEM Questions
    Difficulties and dissatisfaction
    "What challenges are you facing?"

I - IMPLICATION Questions
    Consequences of the problems
    "What effect does that have on [area]?"
    "What happens if you don't solve this?"

N - NEED-PAYOFF Questions
    Value of the solution
    "How would it help if you could [benefit]?"
    "What would solving this be worth?"
```

### Framework 4: NEPQ (Miner)

Neuro-Emotional Persuasion Questioning - let prospects close themselves:

```
CONNECTING QUESTIONS
"What made you decide to take this call?"
"What are you hoping to get out of this?"

SITUATION QUESTIONS
"Walk me through how you're currently handling [area]..."

PROBLEM AWARENESS QUESTIONS
"What's the most frustrating part?"
"How long has this been going on?"

SOLUTION AWARENESS QUESTIONS
"What would it mean if you could solve this?"
"If there was a way to [outcome], how would that change things?"
```

**Tone Layering (NEPQ):**
- **Curious tone**: Rising inflection for exploration
- **Concerned tone**: Softer, slower for pain
- **Skeptical tone**: Flat, questioning for challenge
- **Confused tone**: Uncertain for redirection

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Phase 1: Pre-Call Preparation

Before writing the script, complete this analysis:

```
PROSPECT ANALYSIS:
□ Who is the ideal prospect? [Demographics, psychographics]
□ What problem do they have? [Symptom vs. root cause]
□ What emotional pain does this cause? [Fear, frustration, shame]
□ What logical impact exists? [Time, money, opportunity cost]
□ What have they likely tried? [Past failed solutions]
□ Why are those insufficient? [Gaps in previous approaches]

OFFER ANALYSIS:
□ What is the core transformation? [Before → After]
□ What makes this different? [Unique mechanism]
□ What proof exists? [Case studies, data, testimonials]
□ What objections will arise? [Top 5]
□ What is the risk reversal? [Guarantee, trial]
```

### Phase 2: Call Structure Selection

Choose the appropriate call structure:

```
OPTION A: ONE-CALL CLOSE (Simple offer, <$3K)
Duration: 30-45 minutes
Structure: Discovery → Pitch → Close
Best for: Low-mid ticket, single decision maker

OPTION B: SETTER + CLOSER (High-ticket, >$5K)
Setter Call: 15-20 min (qualify + book)
Closer Call: 45-60 min (full presentation)
Best for: High-ticket, needs extensive discovery

OPTION C: STRATEGY CALL (Consultative)
Duration: 60-90 minutes
Structure: Audit → Diagnosis → Prescription → Close
Best for: Complex sales, multiple stakeholders
```

### Phase 3: Opening Script (Minutes 0-5)

**Objective:** Build rapport, set expectations, gain permission.

```
OPENING TEMPLATE:

"Hey [Name], this is [Your Name] from [Company].
Can you hear me okay? Great.

Before we dive in, I want to set some expectations for our call.

I'm going to ask you some questions to understand your situation.
Then I'll share what we do and see if it's a fit.
If it makes sense for both of us, we can talk about working together.
If it doesn't make sense, I'll tell you that too.

Sound fair?

[Wait for yes]

Great. So tell me... what made you book this call today?"
```

**Opening Variations:**

```
VARIATION 1: REFERRAL OPENING
"Hey [Name], [Referrer] mentioned you were looking for help with [area].
They thought we'd be a good fit to chat.
What's going on that made you interested?"

What caught your attention about that?"

VARIATION 3: APPLICATION OPENING
"Hey [Name], I reviewed your application and had some questions.

```

### Phase 4: Discovery Questions (Minutes 5-25)

TIER 4: EMOTIONAL QUESTIONS (2-3 questions)
Purpose: Connect to feelings

"How do you feel about that situation?"
"What's that doing to you personally?"
"When you think about [problem], what comes up for you?"
"What would it mean to finally solve this?"

TIER 5: COMMITMENT QUESTIONS (2-3 questions)
Purpose: Establish urgency and readiness

"On a scale of 1-10, how important is solving this?"
"What would solving this be worth to you?"
"If you could wave a magic wand and fix this, what would that look like?"
"Are you ready to do something about this, or are you just exploring?"
```

**Discovery Flow Example:**

```
YOU: "Tell me about your current business..."

THEM: "I'm a coach doing about $100K/year."

YOU: "Got it. And what challenges are you facing?"

THEM: "I can't seem to scale past where I am."

YOU: "Tell me more about that..."

YOU: "How long has this been going on?"

THEM: "About 2 years now."

YOU: "What have you tried to fix it?"

THEM: "Courses, masterminds, different marketing..."

YOU: "And did those work?"

THEM: "Not really. I'm still in the same place."

YOU: "How does that feel?"

THEM: "Honestly? Frustrating. I feel stuck."

YOU: "What happens if nothing changes in the next year?"

THEM: "I'll probably burn out. I can't keep going like this."

YOU: "On a scale of 1-10, how urgent is solving this?"

THEM: "It's a 9. I need to figure this out."

[PAIN ESTABLISHED - Ready for transition]
```

### Phase 5: Transition to Presentation (Minutes 25-28)

**Objective:** Bridge from their pain to your solution.

```
TRANSITION TEMPLATE:

- You've tried [past attempts] but they didn't work because [reason]
- And what you really want is [dream outcome]

Did I get that right?

[Wait for confirmation]

Great. Let me share how we've helped people in your exact situation..."
```

```
VARIATION 1: DIAGNOSIS TRANSITION
"Based on what you've told me, I see three main issues:

## Complete Objection Scripts

### Objection 1: "I need to think about it"

```
SCRIPT:

YOU: "I totally understand. This is a big decision and thinking it through is smart.

[CLARIFY]
Just so I can help - when you say you need to think about it, what specifically are you thinking about?

Is it:
- The investment?
- Whether it's the right fit?
- The timing?
- Something else?

[Wait for answer]

THEM: [Gives real concern]

YOU: [Address that specific concern]

Then ask: "If we can address that, are you ready to move forward today?"
```

**Alternative paths:**

```
IF THEY SAY "THE INVESTMENT":
"I get it. Let me ask - is it that you don't have the funds,
or you're not sure it's worth the investment?"

[If not sure it's worth it]:
"Fair. What would [the result we discussed] be worth to you?
If you could guarantee that outcome, what would you pay?"

[If don't have funds]:
"What could you do to make this happen?
Do you have access to credit?
We do have payment options - would $X/month work better?"
```

```
IF THEY SAY "WHETHER IT'S RIGHT FOR ME":
"That's an important consideration. Let me ask you:

Based on what we discussed:
- You have [problem]
- You want [outcome]
- You've tried [other things] that didn't work

What specifically makes you unsure this would be different?"

[Address their specific concern]

"Given that, does it make sense to move forward?"
```

```
IF THEY SAY "THE TIMING":
"I understand. Timing matters.

Help me understand - is this a 'not right now' or 'never'?

[If not right now]:
"When would be better? And what changes between now and then?

Here's what I've found: [thing they're waiting for] rarely changes on its own.
The best time to start is when you've identified the problem - which is now.

What would need to happen for now to be the right time?"
```

### Objection 2: "It's too expensive"

```
SCRIPT:

YOU: "I appreciate you being upfront about that.

[CLARIFY]
Help me understand - when you say it's too expensive, compared to what?

- Compared to the cost of staying where you are?
- Compared to what you expected?
- Compared to another option you're considering?

[Wait for answer]

THEM: [Gives context]
```

**Alternative paths:**

```
IF COMPARED TO STAYING WHERE THEY ARE:
"Let me ask you this:

You mentioned [problem] is costing you [X per month/year].
Over the next 12 months, that's $[total cost of problem].

The investment here is $[price].

If we solve this problem, you actually SAVE $[difference].

Does it make more financial sense to invest now and solve it,
or keep paying the cost of the problem?"
```

```
IF COMPARED TO THEIR EXPECTATION:
"I understand. What were you expecting?

[Listen]

The reason for the investment is [explain value].

Let me break it down another way:
$[price] over [X months] = $[per month]
That's $[per day] per day for [major benefit].

Is that worth it to finally solve [their problem]?"
```

```
IF COMPARED TO A COMPETITOR:
"That's smart to compare. What are you looking at?

[Listen]

Here's how we compare:
[Differentiator 1]
[Differentiator 2]
[Differentiator 3]

The reason we're priced this way is [value explanation].

Based on those differences, which makes more sense for your situation?"
```

**Payment Plan Pivot:**

```
"I hear you on the investment.

We do have payment options that might work better:
- [Option 1]: $X/month for Y months
- [Option 2]: $A upfront + $B/month

Which of those would make this more manageable for you?"
```

### Objection 3: "I need to talk to my spouse/partner"

```
SCRIPT:

YOU: "Of course - big decisions should be made together. I'd do the same thing.

[CLARIFY]
When you talk to them, what do you think they'll say?"

THEM: [Predicts response]
```

**Alternative paths:**

```
IF THEY THINK SPOUSE WILL BE SUPPORTIVE:
"Great! Since they're likely to support it, why don't we get them on the phone right now?

That way I can answer any questions they have directly, and you two can decide together.

What's the best way to reach them?"
```

```
IF THEY THINK SPOUSE WILL HAVE CONCERNS:
"Understandable. What concerns do you think they'll have?

[Listen to each concern]

Let me address those:
[Concern 1]: [Response]
[Concern 2]: [Response]
[Concern 3]: [Response]

If you can share those points with them, do YOU feel confident about moving forward?

[If yes]:
Great. Here's what I suggest:
Talk to them tonight, share what we discussed, and let's reconnect tomorrow at [time].

Does that work?

[Schedule specific follow-up]"
```

```
IF SPOUSE/PARTNER ISN'T AVAILABLE NOW:
"I understand they're not available right now.

Here's what I'd suggest:
1. I'll send you a summary email you can share with them
2. Let's schedule a call for tomorrow at [time] when they CAN be there
3. We'll make the decision together on that call

Does that work?"
```

### Objection 4: "I've been burned before"

```
SCRIPT:

YOU: "I'm really sorry to hear that. That's frustrating - and unfortunately too common.

[CLARIFY]
What happened?"

THEM: [Shares their story]

YOU: "I appreciate you sharing that. That would make me cautious too.

[EMPATHIZE]
The truth is, not every solution works for everyone, and some providers don't deliver.

[DIFFERENTIATE]
Here's how we're different:
1. [Specific differentiator addressing their past failure]
2. [Another differentiator]
3. [Your guarantee that protects them]

[CLOSE]
Given our [guarantee], you're completely protected.
If we don't deliver, you get [refund/money back/etc].

Does that give you enough confidence to move forward?"
```

### Objection 5: "I want to do more research"

```
SCRIPT:

YOU: "I appreciate thoroughness. That's smart.

[CLARIFY]
What specifically do you want to research?"

THEM: [Names specific area]

YOU: "I can probably answer that right now. What do you want to know about [area]?

[Provide the information]

Does that answer your question?

[If yes]:
Great. Any other questions before we move forward?

[If no]:
What else would you need to research?

[Continue until all questions answered]

Now that we've covered those points, are you ready to proceed?"
```

### Objection 6: "Let me check with my team/boss"

```
SCRIPT:

YOU: "Makes sense - big decisions often need buy-in.

[CLARIFY]
Who else is involved in this decision?
And what do you think their concerns will be?

[Listen]

[STRATEGIZE]
Here's what I suggest:
1. I'll send you a proposal document you can share
2. Let's schedule a call where everyone can join
3. That way I can address their questions directly

When would work for that group call?"
```

### Objection 7: "I don't have time right now"

```
SCRIPT:

YOU: "I hear you - time is precious.

[CLARIFY]
When you say you don't have time, is it:
- Time to implement the solution?
- Time in your schedule generally?
- Time to focus on this specific area?

[Listen]

[REFRAME]
Here's the thing:
The problem you described is COSTING you time - [X hours/week].
Our solution actually SAVES you time - [Y hours/week].

So the question isn't 'do you have time for this?'
It's 'can you afford NOT to make time for this?'

What would you do with [Y extra hours] per week?"
```

### Objection 8: "Can you send me more information?"

```
SCRIPT:

YOU: "Absolutely, I can send you information.

[CLARIFY]
Before I do - what specific questions do you have that the information would answer?

[Listen]

Actually, let me answer those right now:
[Answer each question]

Does that cover what you wanted to know?

[If yes]:
Great. So what's stopping us from moving forward today?

[If no]:
What else would you need to know?

[Continue until done]

Now that we've covered everything, ready to get started?"
```
