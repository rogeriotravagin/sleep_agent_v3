# Blend Task - Copy Style Blending Master Protocol

## Meta

```yaml
task_id: blend
version: 2.0.0
category: copy_creation
complexity: advanced
estimated_time: 45-90 min
dependencies:
  - extract-communication-dna.md
  - extract-frameworks.md
related_agents:

```

---

## Purpose

Create hybrid copy by strategically combining elements from 2-4 copywriters, resulting in unique pieces that capture the best attributes of each source while maintaining coherence, flow, and a distinct unified voice.

**Core Philosophy:** Copy blending is a measurable science, not an art. Using the Seven-Dimensional Voice Profile system, any blend can be calculated, executed, and validated with precision.

---

## When to Use

### Ideal Use Cases

| Situation | Why Blending Works |
|-----------|-------------------|
| No single copywriter matches needs 100% | Combine complementary strengths |
| Creating unique brand voice | Differentiate from pure styles |
| High-stakes copy needing multiple persuasion layers | Layer different techniques |
| Bridging classic and modern audiences | Combine eras appropriately |
| Premium products needing credibility + warmth | Blend Ogilvy sophistication + Halbert connection |
| Launch campaigns in saturated markets | Combine awareness (Schwartz) + urgency (Kennedy) |
| VSL with strong story component | Blend Benson structure + Halbert narrative |
| Long-form with hypnotic bullets | Combine Bencivenga fascinations + Sugarman flow |

### When NOT to Use

- Simple, straightforward copy (use single copywriter)
- Time-constrained projects (blending takes longer)
- Brand with established voice (match existing, don't blend)
- Client specifically requests one copywriter style
- Learning copywriting (master singles before blending)

## The Seven-Dimensional Voice Profile System

### Core Dimensions

Every copywriter's voice is mapped across seven measurable dimensions:

```
STRUCTURAL DIMENSIONS (WTF Framework)

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Pre-Blend Analysis

#### Step 1.1: Validate Copywriter Selection

```
COMPATIBILITY CHECK:

1. Are the copywriters compatible?
   [ ] Voice profiles don't have extreme opposites (>6 gap on any dimension)
   [ ] Eras are compatible or bridged intentionally
   [ ] Styles serve the same goal (conversion, brand, engagement)

2. Is blending justified?
   [ ] No single copywriter achieves 100% of requirements
   [ ] Blend adds value (not just variety for variety's sake)
   [ ] Client/project benefits from hybrid approach

3. Is the blend realistic?
   [ ] Maximum 4 copywriters
   [ ] Clear proportion hierarchy (one is dominant, 60%+)
   [ ] Primary copywriter defines structure
```

**Compatibility Matrix Reference:**

| Blend | Compatibility | Best For |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| Halbert + Ogilvy | ★★★★☆ | Premium products with story |
| Halbert + Schwartz | ★★★★★ | Awareness-based storytelling |
| Halbert + Kennedy | ★★★★☆ | Direct urgency with warmth |
| Ogilvy + Schwartz | ★★★★☆ | Sophisticated theory |
| Ogilvy + Hopkins | ★★★★★ | Scientific elegance |
| Schwartz + Kennedy | ★★★★★ | Awareness + urgency |
| Benson + Halbert | ★★★★★ | VSL with story |
| Bencivenga + Sugarman | ★★★★☆ | Bullets with flow |
| Carlton + Halbert | ★★★★★ | Simple directness |

**Incompatible Blends (Avoid):**
- Hopkins + Kern (era collision)
- Ogilvy + Settle (formal vs ultra-casual)
- Schwartz + Settle (dense theory vs daily email)

#### Step 1.2: Calculate Target Profile

```
BLEND CALCULATION FORMULA:

For each dimension D:
D_blend = Σ (D_copywriter × weight_copywriter)

Example: Halbert (60%) + Ogilvy (40%)

Vocabulary:    (4 × 0.6) + (8 × 0.4) = 5.6 ≈ 6
Tone Warmth:   (9 × 0.6) + (5 × 0.4) = 7.4 ≈ 7
Cadence:       (3 × 0.6) + (7 × 0.4) = 4.6 ≈ 5
Formality:     (2 × 0.6) + (8 × 0.4) = 4.4 ≈ 4
Humor:         (7 × 0.6) + (3 × 0.4) = 5.4 ≈ 5
Respect:       (5 × 0.6) + (9 × 0.4) = 6.6 ≈ 7
Enthusiasm:    (8 × 0.6) + (4 × 0.4) = 6.4 ≈ 6

TARGET BLEND PROFILE:
[6, 7, 5, 4, 5, 7, 6]
```

#### Step 1.3: Create Vocabulary Guide

Compile merged vocabulary lists from selected copywriters:

```yaml
blended_vocabulary:

  power_words:
    from_halbert: [amazing, secret, discover, listen]
    from_ogilvy: [research, proven, quality]
    merged: [amazing, discover, research, proven, secret]

  transitions:
    from_halbert: ["Here's the deal", "Let me explain"]
    from_ogilvy: ["Moreover", "The evidence suggests"]
    merged: ["Here's what the research shows", "Let me explain what we found"]

  forbidden:
    all_sources: [heretofore, utilize, excessive hype, vague claims]

  bridging_phrases:
    # Phrases that work in BOTH styles
    - "The truth is..."
    - "What I discovered was..."
    - "Here's why this matters..."
    - "Consider this..."
```

### Phase 2: Structure Design

#### Step 2.1: Section Assignment

Determine which copywriter influences each section:

```yaml
section_assignment:

  # Option A: Proportional throughout
  proportional:
    every_section: blend_by_proportion

  # Option B: Section-specific assignment
  assigned:
    headline: copywriter_best_at_hooks
    lead: copywriter_best_at_engagement
    body: proportional_blend
    proof: copywriter_best_at_credibility
    close: copywriter_best_at_conversion

  # Option C: Dominant with touches
  dominant:
    base_structure: primary_copywriter
    accent_elements: secondary_copywriter
```

**Recommended Assignments by Copy Type:**

| Copy Type | Headline | Lead | Body | Proof | Close |
|-----------|----------|------|------|-------|-------|
| Sales Page | Ogilvy | Halbert | Blend | Ogilvy | Halbert |
| VSL | Benson | Benson | Blend | Bencivenga | Halbert |
| Email | Halbert | Halbert | Blend | Kennedy | Kennedy |
| Landing Page | Schwartz | Collier | Blend | Hopkins | Kennedy |
| Webinar Script | Benson | Halbert | Blend | Ogilvy | Kennedy |

#### Step 2.2: Transition Planning

Map how styles will flow between sections:

```
TRANSITION TYPES:

1. GRADUAL FADE
   Section A (100% Style 1)
   Transition ¶ (70% Style 1, 30% Style 2)
   Transition ¶ (50% / 50%)
   Transition ¶ (30% Style 1, 70% Style 2)
   Section B (100% Style 2)

2. SECTION BREAK
   Section A [Style 1]
   ─────────────────────
   Section B [Style 2]
   (Visual break justifies voice shift)

3. VOICE BRIDGING
   "Now that you understand [Style 1 content],
   let me share something different..." [Style 2]

4. PERSPECTIVE SHIFT
   "I" (personal, Style 1) →
   "You" (direct, transition) →
   "We" (collaborative, Style 2)
```

**Transition Phrase Library:**

| From → To | Bridging Phrase |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Casual → Formal | "Now, let me share some research that backs this up..." |
| Formal → Casual | "But here's what that really means for you..." |
| Story → Data | "And the numbers confirm what I experienced..." |
| Data → Story | "Let me tell you what those statistics actually look like in real life..." |
| Personal → Universal | "And I'm not alone. Thousands of people..." |
| Technical → Emotional | "Forget the jargon for a moment. Here's what this feels like..." |

#### Step 2.3: Identify Fusion Points

Find natural overlap areas where styles complement:

```
FUSION POINT ANALYSIS:

Halbert + Ogilvy Fusion Points:
├── Personal stories backed by data
├── Emotional appeals with research support
├── Direct address with professional credibility
├── Casual tone + specific statistics
└── Storytelling with factual precision

Schwartz + Kennedy Fusion Points:
├── Awareness-based urgency
├── Desire-driven deadlines
├── Mechanism-focused offers
├── Market sophistication + scarcity
└── Logical persuasion + action pressure

Benson + Halbert Fusion Points:
├── Video storytelling structure
├── Curiosity loops with narrative
├── Emotional hooks with personal appeal
├── VSL format with letter warmth
└── Pattern interrupt + relationship building
```

### Phase 3: Copy Creation

#### Step 3.1: Create Headline

Apply the dominant headline-writer's formula with blended vocabulary:

```
HEADLINE CREATION PROCESS:

1. Identify headline copywriter (from section_assignment)
2. Use their headline formula
3. Apply blended vocabulary
4. Verify dimensions match target profile
5. Test readability (should match target vocabulary level)

EXAMPLE: Halbert (60%) + Ogilvy (40%) for Course

Ogilvy formula: "How to [benefit] with [specific method]"
Halbert vocabulary: discovery, personal results
Ogilvy vocabulary: specific numbers, research

BLENDED HEADLINE:
"How 147 Unknown Writers Discovered the $2.4 Million
Copywriting Method (And How You Can Too)"

Verification:
- Specificity (Ogilvy): ✓ (147 writers, $2.4M)
- Personal promise (Halbert): ✓ ("You Can Too")
- Grade level: 7 (target: 6) ✓
```

#### Step 3.2: Create Lead

Write opening section applying assigned copywriter's style:

```
LEAD CREATION PROCESS:

1. Identify lead copywriter
2. Select their lead pattern (story, fact, challenge, curiosity)
3. Write in their pure voice first
4. Add touches from secondary copywriter
5. Verify emotional dimensions match blend

EXAMPLE: Halbert lead with Ogilvy touches

PURE HALBERT:
"Dear Friend,

Let me tell you something crazy that happened last Tuesday.

I was sitting at my kitchen table, third cup of coffee going
cold, when my phone buzzed..."

WITH OGILVY TOUCHES:
"Dear Friend,

Let me tell you something that changed how I think about
copywriting forever.

I was reviewing the results from our latest test—147 writers,
all from different backgrounds—when the numbers stopped me cold.

The average wasn't supposed to be this high..."

Verification:
- Personal opening (Halbert): ✓
- Research reference (Ogilvy): ✓
- Warmth level: 7 (target) ✓
- Formality: 4 (target) ✓
```

#### Step 3.3: Create Body

Execute the proportional blend throughout main content:

```
BODY WRITING PROTOCOL:

For each paragraph:

1. DETERMINE PRIMARY INFLUENCE
   - What's the paragraph's purpose?
   - Which copywriter excels at this?
   - Default to proportion if unclear

2. WRITE FIRST DRAFT
   - Use primary copywriter's voice
   - Maintain their sentence structure
   - Use their vocabulary patterns

3. APPLY SECONDARY INFLUENCE
   - Add touches from other copywriter(s)
   - Replace some vocabulary
   - Adjust cadence if needed

4. VERIFY BLEND
   - Check against target dimensions
   - Ensure no "seams" visible
   - Read aloud for flow

PARAGRAPH-LEVEL BLEND EXAMPLE:

Purpose: Explain the mechanism
Primary: Ogilvy (clarity, credibility)
Secondary: Halbert (accessibility, warmth)

FIRST DRAFT (Pure Ogilvy):
"The methodology operates through a three-phase process.
First, we analyze your current patterns. Second, we identify
optimization opportunities. Third, we implement systematic
improvements based on empirical testing."

BLENDED VERSION (70% Ogilvy, 30% Halbert):
"Here's how the method actually works.

First, I look at what you're already doing. (No judgment—
just data collection.)

Second, I find the gaps—the places where small changes
create big results.

Third—and this is where it gets exciting—we implement
those changes based on what's actually tested and proven."

Changes applied:
- "Here's how" (Halbert transition)
- Shorter paragraphs (Halbert structure)
- Parenthetical asides (Halbert personality)
- "tested and proven" (Ogilvy credibility)
```

#### Step 3.4: Create Proof Section

Apply credibility-specialist copywriter's approach:

```
PROOF SECTION PATTERNS:

OGILVY-STYLE PROOF:
"Research conducted across 3,000 participants showed...
In controlled testing, the average improvement was 47%...
Dr. [Name], Professor at [University], noted that..."

HALBERT-STYLE PROOF:
"Let me tell you about Tom. Tom was a lot like you—
frustrated, skeptical, and down to his last $500.
Six months later, Tom sent me this letter..."

KENNEDY-STYLE PROOF:
"Don't take my word for it. Here's what happened when
real business owners implemented this:
• John M. - $127,000 in 90 days
• Sarah T. - 3X her revenue in 6 months
• Mike R. - Quit his job in 4 months"

BLENDED PROOF (Ogilvy 40% + Halbert 60%):
"Let me share something that surprised even me.

When we tested this with 147 writers—not professionals,
just regular people who wanted to learn—the average
income increase was $16,326 in 90 days.

But statistics don't capture what really happened.

Take Maria, a retired teacher from Ohio. She told me:
'I thought copywriting was for young people with marketing
degrees. I was wrong. Three months in, I earned more than
my monthly pension—from a single client.'"
```

#### Step 3.5: Create Close

Apply conversion-specialist copywriter's closing technique:

```
CLOSING PATTERNS BY COPYWRITER:

HALBERT CLOSE:
"Look, I've laid it all out for you.

You know what this is. You know what it costs.
You know what you could make.

The only question left is: are you going to do this?

Here's the link: [URL]

I hope to see your name on the other side.

Sincerely,
[Name]

P.S. Remember—the price goes up Friday at midnight."

KENNEDY CLOSE:
"Let me be blunt.

This offer expires in 72 hours. At midnight on Friday,
two things happen:

1. The price increases by $200
2. The bonuses disappear

I'm not playing games. I don't do fake scarcity.

If you want in, now is the time.

Click here: [URL]

Warning: If you click and see a different price,
you're too late."

OGILVY CLOSE:
"We invite you to experience this yourself.

For a limited time, qualified applicants may apply for
consideration. Our team reviews each application
personally to ensure mutual fit.

To request an application: [URL]"

BLENDED CLOSE (Halbert 70% + Kennedy 30%):
"Okay, I've shown you everything.

The method. The results. The proof.

Now here's what happens next:

Click the button below and join before Friday at midnight.

Why the deadline? Simple—after Friday, I'm raising the
price by $200. Not because I'm greedy. Because my time
is limited and I want serious people only.

Are you serious?

[JOIN NOW]

Sincerely,
[Name]

P.S. If you're still reading, you're interested. Trust that.
Click now. The worst thing that happens is you get a refund.
The best thing? Your life changes."
```

### Phase 4: Quality Validation

#### Step 4.1: Voice Consistency Audit

```yaml
VOICE AUDIT CHECKLIST:

vocabulary_consistency:
  [ ] Grade level consistent throughout (±1 level)
  [ ] Power words from correct copywriter(s)
  [ ] No forbidden words from any source
  [ ] Transitions match target profile
  [ ] Technical terms consistent
  [ ] Slang/colloquialisms at appropriate level

cadence_consistency:
  [ ] Sentence length varies within target range
  [ ] Paragraph structure matches template
  [ ] Punctuation frequency within parameters
  [ ] Formatting conventions followed
  [ ] Rhythm feels natural when read aloud

tone_consistency:
  [ ] Emotional tone maintained throughout
  [ ] Reader relationship consistent
  [ ] Humor level appropriate and even
  [ ] Formality level steady
  [ ] Enthusiasm matches target

blend_integrity:
  [ ] Proportions respected (can measure by technique count)
  [ ] Fusion points feel natural
  [ ] Transitions smooth (no jarring shifts)
  [ ] No visible "seams" between styles
  [ ] Overall voice feels unified, not patchwork
```

#### Step 4.2: Dimension Verification

Score the final copy against target profile:

```
DIMENSION SCORING:

Read the copy and rate each dimension 1-10.
Compare to calculated target profile.

Target Profile: [6, 7, 5, 4, 5, 7, 6]
Actual Score:   [_, _, _, _, _, _, _]

Acceptable variance: ±1 on any dimension
Concerning variance: ±2 on any dimension
Failure: ±3 or more on any dimension

If variance exceeds acceptable:
1. Identify sections causing drift
2. Rewrite those sections
3. Re-score and validate
```

#### Step 4.3: Read-Aloud Test

```
READ-ALOUD PROTOCOL:

1. Read entire piece aloud (or use text-to-speech)
2. Mark any points where you:
   - Stumble on phrasing
   - Feel a tone shift
   - Notice rhythm break
   - Sense style change

3. For each marked point:
   - Is it intentional (section break)?
   - Is it a blend failure (seam)?
   - Does it serve the reader?

4. Rewrite marked sections if they're blend failures
```

#### Step 4.4: Blind Test (Optional)

```
BLIND TEST PROTOCOL:

1. Show blended copy to 3 people familiar with copywriter styles
2. Ask them:
   - "Which copywriters influenced this piece?"
   - "What proportion would you estimate for each?"
   - "Where do you see each style most clearly?"

3. Score results:
   - Correct copywriter identification: Success
   - Proportion guess within ±15%: Success
   - Couldn't identify copywriters: Strong blend (potentially too blended)
   - Named wrong copywriters: Blend failure

4. Use feedback to calibrate future blends
```

### Phase 5: Documentation

#### Step 5.1: Generate DNA Analysis

Create detailed breakdown of the blend:

```markdown
## DNA Analysis

### Blend Summary
- **Primary Copywriter:** Gary Halbert (60%)
- **Secondary Copywriter:** David Ogilvy (40%)
- **Copy Type:** Sales Page
- **Target Audience:** Aspiring copywriters, problem-aware

### Target Profile vs. Actual
| Dimension | Target | Actual | Variance |
|-----------|--------|--------|----------|
| Vocabulary | 6 | 6 | 0 |
| Warmth | 7 | 7 | 0 |
| Cadence | 5 | 5 | 0 |
| Formality | 4 | 5 | +1 |
| Humor | 5 | 4 | -1 |
| Respect | 7 | 7 | 0 |
| Enthusiasm | 6 | 6 | 0 |

### Elements from Gary Halbert
- **Opening:** Personal letter format ("Dear Friend")
- **Storytelling:** Kitchen table scene, personal revelation
- **Vocabulary:** "crazy", "here's the deal", "look"
- **Structure:** Short paragraphs, conversational flow
- **Close:** Direct personal appeal, P.S. with urgency

### Elements from David Ogilvy
- **Headline:** Specific numbers (147 writers, $2.4M)
- **Proof:** Research framework, data presentation
- **Credibility:** Institutional references, testing methodology
- **Vocabulary:** "research", "evidence", "participants"
- **Tone:** Underlying sophistication, professional credibility

### Fusion Points
- **Para 3:** Personal story supported by data
- **Para 7:** Emotional appeal with research citation
- **Proof section:** Story format with statistical backing
- **Close:** Personal warmth with specific deadline

### Transition Locations
- **After headline → lead:** Shift from data to personal
- **After proof → close:** Shift from evidence to appeal
- **P.S.:** Returns to pure Halbert energy
```

#### Step 5.2: Create Copywriter Markers

Annotate where each style appears:

```
COPYWRITER MARKERS:

[H] = Halbert element
[O] = Ogilvy element
[F] = Fusion point (both)

---

[O] "How 147 Unknown Writers Discovered the $2.4 Million

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

### The Frankenstein Effect

**Symptom:** Copy feels like disconnected pieces stitched together
**Cause:** No transition strategy, abrupt style switches
**Solution:** Use gradual fades, bridging phrases, consistent thread

### Identity Loss

**Symptom:** No distinct voice recognizable—bland, generic
**Cause:** Blending too many voices, or averaging to mediocrity
**Solution:** Limit to 2-3 copywriters, one dominant at 60%+

### Proportion Drift

**Symptom:** Promised 60/40 but delivered 90/10
**Cause:** Writer fatigue, defaulting to comfort zone
**Solution:** Measure after writing, count techniques from each source

### Seam Visibility

**Symptom:** Reader can feel exactly where style changes
**Cause:** Section-based blending without transitions
**Solution:** Use transition paragraphs, read aloud for smoothness

### Audience Whiplash

**Symptom:** Reader confused about who's "speaking"
**Cause:** Combining incompatible extremes
**Solution:** Check compatibility matrix, choose neighboring profiles

### Era Collision

**Symptom:** Anachronistic language, mixed-period feel
**Cause:** Blending 1920s Hopkins with modern Settle
**Solution:** Modernize classic voices before blending

## Examples

### Example 1: Premium Course Sales Page

**Blend:** Halbert (60%) + Ogilvy (40%)
**Target Profile:** [6, 7, 5, 4, 5, 7, 6]

HEADLINE:
How 147 Unknown Writers Made $2.4 Million Using This
Unusual Copywriting Method

LEAD:
Dear Friend,

Let me tell you something that changed everything I thought
I knew about teaching copywriting.

I was reviewing the results from our latest group—147 writers
from completely different backgrounds—when the numbers
stopped me cold.

The average wasn't supposed to be this high.

These weren't professionals. They were people just like you—
nurses, teachers, accountants, even a retired Marine sergeant
who "never wrote anything longer than an email."

Yet there they were. Averaging $16,326 in the first 90 days.

That's more than most copywriting courses promise after
a full year.

PROOF:
Let me share the data, then I'll tell you the stories behind it.

Across 147 participants over 18 months:
• Average income increase: $16,326 (90 days)
• Highest earner: $127,000 (Maria, retired teacher, Ohio)
• Lowest earner: $2,400 (still 4X the course cost)
• Success rate: 89% earned at least $5,000

But numbers don't tell the whole story.

Let me tell you about Tom...

[continues with personal story backed by data]

CLOSE:
Look, I've laid everything out for you.

The method. The proof. The results.

Here's what happens next: click the button below and
join us before Friday at midnight.

Why the deadline? After Friday, two things happen.
The price goes up $200. And the current bonuses disappear.

This isn't fake scarcity. It's how I run every launch.
Decisive people deserve better pricing.

Are you decisive?

[JOIN NOW - $997]

Sincerely,
[Name]

P.S. Still reading? Good. That means you're interested
but cautious. I respect that. Here's what I'll do:
join now, go through the first module, and if you don't
see why this is different—get a full refund. No questions.
Your caution protected. Your opportunity secured.
```

### Example 2: VSL for Supplement

**Blend:** Benson (50%) + Bencivenga (50%)
**Target Profile:** [5, 7, 4, 2, 4, 6, 8]

```
HOOK (Benson):
What I'm about to show you in the next 12 minutes
could completely change how you experience energy.

But I have to warn you...

This isn't about caffeine. It's not about energy drinks.
And it definitely isn't what your doctor told you.

What you're about to discover goes against almost
everything you've been taught about tiredness.

FASCINATIONS (Bencivenga):
In the next few minutes, you'll discover:

• The "forgotten mineral" that doubled energy levels
  in a Johns Hopkins study—yet 87% of Americans are
  deficient (hint: it's not magnesium)

• Why your morning coffee actually DRAINS your energy
  by 2pm—and the 3-gram alternative that keeps you
  alert until bedtime without a single crash

• The bizarre discovery a sleep-deprived biochemist
  made at 3am that now helps him sleep 8 hours AND
  wake up more energized than he felt at 20

• How Olympic athletes are secretly abandoning energy
  drinks for a compound you can get at any grocery
  store (costs less than $3 per week)

CLOSE (Blended):
You felt it, didn't you?

That spark of curiosity? That "wait, what?" moment?

That's exactly what you'll feel every single morning
when you wake up with natural, sustained energy
flowing through your body.

No crashes. No jitters. No afternoon slump.

Just clean, focused energy from the moment you open
your eyes until you decide it's time for bed.
