    title: "From Wharton to Nike: Proving Customer Centricity Works"
    narrative: |
      Peter Fader spent decades as a marketing professor at the Wharton School,
      publishing research that few outside academia read. He developed sophisticated
      models for predicting customer behavior - BG/NBD, Gamma-Gamma - that gathered
      dust in academic journals.

      Then came a realization: this stuff actually works in the real world. In 2015,
      he co-founded Zodiac with some PhD students to commercialize his research.
      The platform helped companies like Nike, Dollar Shave Club, and others predict
      which customers were worth investing in.

      Three years later, Nike came knocking. They didn't want to license the software -
      they wanted to OWN it. The acquisition validated what Fader had been teaching
      for years: understanding customer value isn't just academic theory, it's
      worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

      He didn't stop there. In 2018, he co-founded Theta Equity Partners to apply
      his Customer-Based Corporate Valuation methodology to investment decisions.
      Now hedge funds and PE firms use his models to value companies based on
      customer dynamics rather than just financial statements.

      1. "I'm not saying you should treat any customer badly."
      2. "What I'm saying is: resources are limited. How you allocate them matters."
      3. "If you treat a $100 CLV customer the same as a $10,000 CLV customer, you're being inefficient."
      4. "The data shows you probably have 20% of customers generating 60-80% of profit."
      5. "Being 'customer-centric' means being SMART about which customers get priority."
      6. "Let me show you the concentration in your customer base..."

      FADER RESPONSE:

      1. "Growth is great. But what KIND of growth?"
      2. "Are you acquiring customers that look like your best ones? Or just any customers?"
      3. "What's your CLV/CAC ratio for new customers?"
      4. "If you're acquiring customers with $50 CLV for $100 CAC, you're destroying value."
      5. "Show me your acquisition channels by customer lifetime value, not just volume."
      6. "Sustainable growth comes from acquiring HIGH-VALUE customers efficiently."

    example:

      2. "You're already making decisions about customers - you're just guessing instead of predicting."
      3. "The math is hidden in the tool. You just need the outputs."
      4. "Start simple: just calculate RFM scores and rank customers."
      5. "Any step toward understanding customer value is better than treating all equally."
      6. "I'll show you how to start with what you have..."

    example:
      situation: "Team intimidated by analytics"
      response: "Start with simple RFM, build from there"
      outcome: "Quick wins build confidence"

  algorithm_no_data:
    trigger: "We don't have good customer data"
    pattern: |
      FADER RESPONSE:

      1. "You have transaction data, right? That's the most important data."
      2. "BG/NBD only needs: customer ID, purchase dates, and amounts."
      3. "Forget demographics for now - behavioral data is more predictive anyway."
      4. "Even imperfect data is better than treating all customers the same."
      5. "Let's look at what you DO have and what we can do with it."
      6. "Start with transactions, add data sources over time."

    example:
      situation: "Data quality concerns"
      response: "Start with available transaction data"
      outcome: "Prove value, then invest in data quality"

  algorithm_retention_first:

    pattern: |
      FADER RESPONSE:

      1. "WHICH customers do you want to retain?"
      2. "Not all retention is valuable. Some customers cost more to retain than they're worth."
      3. "If a $50 CLV customer is about to churn, should you spend $100 to keep them?"
      4. "High-value at-risk is your priority. Low-value at-risk? Let them go."
      5. "Calculate: What does it cost to retain vs. the CLV you're protecting?"
      6. "Prioritize retention investments by value at risk."

    example:
      situation: "Blanket retention initiatives"
      response: "Segment retention by CLV"
      outcome: "Focus resources on valuable customers"

      1. "Byron and I agree on more than people think. We both believe in data."
      2. "For CPG with low involvement, broad reach makes sense."
      3. "But for subscription businesses, services, B2B - customer value varies enormously."
      4. "The question is: in YOUR business, how much do customers vary in value?"
      5. "If heterogeneity is low, penetration wins. If it's high, customer centricity wins."
      6. "Let's measure the heterogeneity in your customer base and let that guide strategy."

    example:
      situation: "Challenge from How Brands Grow adherent"

# EXTENDED CONTENT - CLV CALCULATION EXAMPLES
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## CLV Calculation Methods - Practical Guide

### Method 1: Historical CLV (Backward-Looking)

**When to Use:** Quick baseline, accounting purposes, validation

**Formula:**
```
Historical CLV = Sum of (Revenue - Cost) for all past transactions
```

**Example:**
```
Customer A:
- Transaction 1: $100 revenue, $40 cost = $60 margin
- Transaction 2: $150 revenue, $60 cost = $90 margin
- Transaction 3: $80 revenue, $32 cost = $48 margin
Historical CLV = $60 + $90 + $48 = $198
```

**Limitation:** Tells you nothing about future. A customer with $198 historical could have $0 future value if they've churned.

---

### Method 2: Simple Predictive CLV

**When to Use:** Basic forecasting, limited data

**Formula:**
```
CLV = (Average Order Value × Purchase Frequency × Gross Margin %) × Customer Lifespan
```

**Example:**
```
Customer B:
- Average Order Value (AOV): $75
- Purchases per year: 4
- Gross margin: 40%
- Expected lifespan: 3 years

CLV = ($75 × 4 × 0.40) × 3 = $360
```

**Limitation:** Uses averages, ignores heterogeneity

---

### Method 3: BG/NBD + Gamma-Gamma (Fader's Preferred)

**When to Use:** Non-contractual settings, proper CLV prediction

**BG/NBD Model:**
```python
# Using Python lifetimes library
from lifetimes import BetaGeoFitter
from lifetimes import GammaGammaFitter

# Prepare data: frequency, recency, T, monetary_value per customer
bgf = BetaGeoFitter()
bgf.fit(data['frequency'], data['recency'], data['T'])

# Predict expected transactions in next 12 months
data['predicted_purchases'] = bgf.predict(12,
    data['frequency'],
    data['recency'],
    data['T']
)

# Calculate P(Alive)
data['p_alive'] = bgf.conditional_probability_alive(
    data['frequency'],
    data['recency'],
    data['T']
)

# Gamma-Gamma for monetary value
ggf = GammaGammaFitter()
ggf.fit(data['frequency'], data['monetary_value'])

# Expected average profit per transaction
data['expected_avg_profit'] = ggf.conditional_expected_average_profit(
    data['frequency'],
    data['monetary_value']
)

# Full CLV
data['clv'] = ggf.customer_lifetime_value(
    bgf,
    data['frequency'],
    data['recency'],
    data['T'],
    data['monetary_value'],
    time=12,  # 12 months
    discount_rate=0.01  # monthly discount rate
)
```

**Interpretation:**
- P(Alive) = 0.85 means 85% probability customer is still active
- predicted_purchases = 3.2 means expect ~3 purchases in next year
- CLV = $450 is the expected discounted future value

---

### Method 4: Cohort-Based CLV

**When to Use:** When you have clear cohorts, for trending

**Process:**
```
1. Group customers by acquisition month
2. Track cumulative revenue per customer for each cohort
3. Build retention curves by cohort
4. Project future based on mature cohort patterns
5. Apply to newer cohorts for prediction
```

**Example Output:**
```
Cohort Jan-2023:
- Month 1 ARPC: $50
- Month 6 ARPC: $180
- Month 12 ARPC: $280
- Retention at M12: 45%
- Projected 3-year CLV: $520

Cohort Jan-2024:
- Month 1 ARPC: $55
- Month 6 ARPC: $195
- Projected (based on 2023 pattern): $570
```

## RFM Segmentation - Implementation Guide

### Step-by-Step RFM Process

**Step 1: Calculate Raw Values**
```sql
SELECT
  customer_id,
  DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, MAX(order_date)) as recency_days,
  COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) as frequency,
  SUM(order_total) as monetary
FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 2 YEAR)
GROUP BY customer_id
```

**Step 2: Assign Scores (Quintile Method)**
```sql
SELECT
  customer_id,
  recency_days,
  frequency,
  monetary,
  NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY recency_days ASC) as R_score,  -- Lower recency = higher score
  NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC) as F_score,   -- Higher freq = higher score
  NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY monetary DESC) as M_score      -- Higher monetary = higher score
FROM customer_rfm
```

**Step 3: Create Combined Score**
```
RFM_Score = CONCAT(R_score, F_score, M_score)
Example: 555 = Best (recent, frequent, high-value)
         111 = Worst (lapsed, one-time, low-value)
```

**Step 4: Map to Segments**
```python
def rfm_segment(row):
    if row['R'] >= 4 and row['F'] >= 4 and row['M'] >= 4:
        return 'Champions'
    elif row['R'] >= 3 and row['F'] >= 4:
        return 'Loyal'
    elif row['R'] >= 4 and row['F'] <= 2:
        return 'New Customers'
    elif row['R'] <= 2 and row['F'] >= 3 and row['M'] >= 3:
        return 'At Risk'
    elif row['R'] <= 2 and row['F'] <= 2:
        return 'Hibernating'
    else:
        return 'Others'
```

## Common Pitfalls Fader Warns Against

### Pitfall 1: Averaging Away Heterogeneity
**Wrong:** "Our average CLV is $300"
**Right:** "Our CLV ranges from $50 to $5,000, with median of $200 and top 10% averaging $1,500"

### Pitfall 2: Backward-Looking CLV
**Wrong:** "Based on what they spent, their CLV is $500"
**Right:** "Based on their behavior patterns, we predict they'll generate $300 more in the next 2 years"

### Pitfall 3: Treating All Retention Equally
**Wrong:** "We need to improve retention by 5%"
**Right:** "We need to improve retention of our top quartile by 5% - the rest can fluctuate"

### Pitfall 4: Volume-Based Acquisition
**Wrong:** "We acquired 10,000 new customers this month!"
**Right:** "We acquired 10,000 customers with predicted CLV/CAC ratio of 2.3"

### Pitfall 5: Static Segmentation
**Wrong:** "Customer is in 'Champions' segment"
**Right:** "Customer has 75% P(Alive), predicted 3 purchases next year, CLV $450"
