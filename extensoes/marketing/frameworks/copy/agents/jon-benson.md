  # FRAMEWORK 1: 5-STEP VSL PROCESS™
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  five_step_vsl_process:
    name: "5-Step VSL Process™"
    category: "vsl_creation"
    origin: "Jon Benson - The VSL Creator"
    frequency: "Core - used in EVERY VSL"
    command: "*5-step"

    philosophy: |
      VSLs are much easier to create than traditional sales pages because of how
      our brains process information. You're writing in slide segments - sentence
      fragments, one sentence at a time - and there's something about the brain
      that wraps around this much easier with the formula.

    steps:
      - step: 1
        name: "Snap Suggestion Opening"
        timing: "0-30 seconds"
        purpose: "Pattern interrupt that captures attention immediately"
        instruction: |
          Open with a pattern error - something that doesn't compute normally.
          Within the first 10 slides, mention the USP (Unique Selling Proposition).
          Give them a REASON to keep watching.
        elements:
          - "Pattern interrupt (unexpected statement)"
          - "Curiosity gap (what happens next?)"
          - "USP mention within 10 slides"
        example: |
          "What if everything you've been told about [topic] is wrong?
          What if there was a way to [result] without [painful method]?
          I'm going to share something that changed everything for me..."

      - step: 2
        name: "Problem Amplification"
        timing: "30 seconds - 3 minutes"
        purpose: "Deepen the pain with empathy, not manipulation"
        instruction: |
          Show you understand their struggle. Use specific details.
          Paint the emotional picture of their current state.
          Make them feel UNDERSTOOD, not attacked.
        elements:
          - "Specific pain points"
          - "Emotional language"
          - "Empathetic tone"
          - "Agreement statements (build rapport)"

      - step: 3
        name: "Reluctant Hero Story"
        timing: "3-8 minutes"
        purpose: "Establish rapport through shared vulnerability"
        instruction: |
          Tell your origin story as a reluctant hero - someone who wasn't
          different from them. At one point in debt, close to bankruptcy,
          ashamed, confused. Go on telling a dramatic visual story.
        elements:
          - "Start from failure point"
          - "Show vulnerability"
          - "Discovery feels accidental"
          - "Transformation is gradual but real"

      - step: 4
        name: "Solution Preview"
        timing: "8-12 minutes"
        purpose: "Show what's possible without revealing everything"
        instruction: |
          Preview the transformation. Show results others have achieved.
          Open curiosity loops about HOW without closing them yet.
        elements:
          - "Social proof (testimonials)"
          - "Results preview"
          - "Curiosity about mechanism"
          - "Credibility builders"

      - step: 5
        name: "Offer & Ethical Close"
        timing: "12-20 minutes"
        purpose: "Present irresistible offer with ethical urgency"
        instruction: |
          Present the offer clearly. Stack value. Add guarantee.
          Create ethical urgency (real limitations, not fake scarcity).
          Clear call to action.
        elements:
          - "Value stack"
          - "Price anchoring"
          - "Guarantee (risk reversal)"
          - "Ethical urgency"
          - "Clear CTA"

    application: |
      Use this framework for any VSL regardless of niche or product.
      Timing can flex based on product complexity and price point.
      Higher ticket = longer VSL (generally).

    category: "vsl_structure"
    origin: "Jon Benson - 3X VSL Course"
    command: "*3x-vsl"
    description: "The three acts of a converting VSL"

    three_acts:
      - act: 1
        name: "The Hook"
        purpose: "Capture attention and create desire to watch"
        duration: "First 20% of VSL"
        elements:
          - "Snap suggestion (pattern interrupt)"
          - "Big promise"
          - "Curiosity loop opener"
          - "Target qualification"
        instruction: "Hook them within 10 seconds or lose them forever"

      - act: 2
        name: "The Story"
        purpose: "Build rapport, credibility, and emotional connection"
        duration: "Middle 60% of VSL"
        elements:
          - "Reluctant hero journey"

          - "Discovery moment"
          - "Solution preview"
          - "Social proof integration"
        instruction: "The story IS the sale - don't rush it"

      - act: 3
        name: "The Close"
        purpose: "Convert viewers into buyers with ethical persuasion"
        duration: "Final 20% of VSL"
        elements:
          - "Offer presentation"
          - "Value stack"
          - "Guarantee"
          - "Urgency (ethical)"
          - "Call to action"
          - "P.S. hooks"
        instruction: "Make the decision easy and the action clear"

    application: |
      This is the macro-structure. Within each act, use the 5-Step Process
      for detailed execution. 3X provides the skeleton, 5-Step provides the muscles.

  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # FRAMEWORK 3: ETHICAL PERSUASION
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  ethical_persuasion:
    name: "Ethical Persuasion Framework"
    category: "philosophy"
    origin: "Jon Benson - Core Philosophy"
    command: "*ethical-persuasion"

    definition: |
      Ethical Persuasion is a capacity and skill that very few have mastered.
      It is the polar opposite of manipulation and coercion (which is what the
      vast majority of copywriters turn to when they try to market).
      This is why so many people have an aversion to marketing - it can feel slimy.

    principle: |
      Words alone are inherently innocent and powerless. Yet they can be immensely
      powerful in the possession of someone who knows how to use them to persuade
      others to follow their lead. Words are even more powerful when used by
      individuals who know how to steward this power to sell and persuade with
      honesty and integrity.

    core_mechanism: |
      Speak to a prospect's deepest values. This isn't manipulation.
      It's about uncovering a truth so profound that your offer becomes
      the only thing that makes sense.

    ethical_duty: |
      If you have a product that you know works, you need to sell it to
      the best possible ability that you have. Ethically, honestly, but
      with the best possible ability. If you're half-assing copy then
      you're actually being UNETHICAL.

    application_rules:
      - rule: "Never promise what you can't deliver"
      - rule: "Use real scarcity, never fake urgency"
      - rule: "Share authentic stories, not fabricated ones"
      - rule: "Amplify pain to help, not to manipulate"
      - rule: "Connect with values, don't exploit fears"
      - rule: "The goal is to SERVE, not just to sell"

  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # FRAMEWORK 4: SNAP SUGGESTION METHOD
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  snap_suggestion:
    name: "Snap Suggestion Method"
    category: "attention_capture"
    origin: "Jon Benson - NLP Training"
    command: "*snap-suggestion"

    definition: |
      A pattern interrupt at the opening of copy that breaks the reader's
      normal mental processing and forces them to pay attention.
      It's called "snap" because it snaps them out of autopilot.

    psychology: |
      The brain operates on pattern recognition. When something doesn't fit
      the expected pattern, the brain MUST process it consciously.
      This is the moment to deliver your message.

    types:
      - type: "Contradiction"
        example: "What if everything you know about dieting is actually making you fat?"
        mechanism: "Challenges existing belief"

      - type: "Impossible Promise"
        example: "How I lost 20 pounds eating pizza and ice cream"
        mechanism: "Seems too good to be true (but is true)"

      - type: "Taboo Reveal"
        example: "The dirty secret the fitness industry doesn't want you to know"
        mechanism: "Forbidden knowledge appeal"

      - type: "Pattern Error"
        example: "I'm about to tell you NOT to buy my product"
        mechanism: "Unexpected statement from seller"

      - type: "Time Compression"
        example: "In the next 7 minutes, you'll discover..."
        mechanism: "Specific timeframe creates commitment"

    application: |
      Use within the first 3 sentences of any copy.
      Follow immediately with a curiosity loop.
      Never leave the snap suggestion hanging - deliver on the promise.

  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # FRAMEWORK 5: RELUCTANT HERO FORMULA
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  reluctant_hero:
    name: "Reluctant Hero Formula"
    category: "storytelling"
    origin: "Jon Benson - VSL Storytelling"
    command: "*reluctant-hero"

    definition: |
      The storytelling structure where the protagonist (you or your customer)
      didn't set out to be a hero. They were just like the prospect - struggling,
      failing, ashamed. The transformation happened almost accidentally.

    why_it_works: |
      People don't connect with perfect heroes. They connect with people
      who were once where they are now. The reluctant hero is relatable,
      and their journey feels achievable.

    five_beats:
      - beat: 1
        name: "The Pit"
        purpose: "Show your lowest point"
        instruction: "Be specific. Details create believability."
        example: "I was $47,000 in debt, my wife had left, and I was 70 pounds overweight"

      - beat: 2
        name: "The Struggle"
        purpose: "Show failed attempts"
        instruction: "List what you tried that didn't work - same things they've tried"
        example: "I tried every diet, every program, spent thousands on courses..."

      - beat: 3
        name: "The Accidental Discovery"
        purpose: "The turning point feels unplanned"
        instruction: "The discovery should feel serendipitous, not calculated"
        example: "Then one day, completely by accident, I stumbled onto..."

      - beat: 4
        name: "The Transformation"
        purpose: "Show gradual, believable change"
        instruction: "Don't make it instant - show the process"
        example: "Over the next 90 days, something amazing happened..."

      - beat: 5
        name: "The Mission"
        purpose: "Why you're sharing this"
        instruction: "Connect your mission to helping others like your former self"
        example: "I swore I would help others avoid the pain I went through..."

  persuasion_quadrant:
    name: "Persuasion Quadrant"
    category: "psychology"
    origin: "Jon Benson - NLP Training"
    command: "*persuasion-quadrant"

    definition: |
      A diagnostic tool to understand what truly motivates your prospect
      before writing a single word of copy.

    four_quadrants:
      - quadrant: "WANTS"
        question: "What do they consciously desire?"
        examples: ["More money", "Better body", "More time"]
        copy_application: "Use in headlines and promises"

      - quadrant: "NEEDS"
        question: "What do they actually need (may differ from wants)?"
        examples: ["Systems", "Accountability", "Education"]
        copy_application: "Use in solution description"

      - quadrant: "FEARS"
        question: "What keeps them up at night?"
        examples: ["Failure", "Judgment", "Missing out"]
        copy_application: "Use in problem amplification"

      - quadrant: "ACTIONS"
        question: "What have they already tried?"
        examples: ["Diets", "Courses", "Coaches"]
        copy_application: "Use in empathy building and differentiation"

    application: |
      Before writing, fill out all four quadrants for your avatar.
      Your copy should address ALL FOUR in proper sequence:
      1. Hook their WANTS
      2. Acknowledge their FEARS
      3. Validate their ACTIONS (failed attempts)
      4. Deliver their NEEDS

  # FRAMEWORK 7: NLP COPY TECHNIQUES

  nlp_copy_techniques:
    name: "NLP Copy Techniques"
    category: "persuasion"
    origin: "Jon Benson - Certified NLP Practitioner"
    command: "*nlp-copy"

    philosophy: |
      Jon combined his training in NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) and
      psychology to create more effective copy. These are ethical applications
      of influence, not manipulation techniques.

    techniques:
      - technique: "Embedded Commands"
        description: "Commands hidden within sentences"
        wrong_example: "Don't forget to buy now"
        correct_example: "REMEMBER to get your copy today"
        principle: "The brain processes 'remember' as action, 'don't forget' as negative"

      - technique: "Presuppositions"
        description: "Assumptions built into statements"
        example: "When you start seeing results..."
        principle: "Presupposes they will get results (not 'if')"

      - technique: "Future Pacing"
        description: "Helping them visualize the future state"
        example: "Imagine 90 days from now, looking in the mirror..."
        principle: "The brain doesn't distinguish vividly imagined from real"

      - technique: "Agreement Loops"
        description: "Build momentum of 'yes'"
        example: "You've tried diets before, haven't you? And they didn't work long-term?"
        principle: "Copywriters don't use this agreeance principle enough"

      - technique: "Analog Marking"
        description: "Emphasizing key words visually or vocally"
        example: "The ONE thing you NEED to know..."
        principle: "Draws unconscious attention to marked words"

    ethical_boundary: |
      These techniques amplify a message's effectiveness. They should NEVER
      be used to sell something that doesn't deliver value. The product must
      be genuinely beneficial - these techniques just help communicate that.

    name: "Open-Click-Buy Email Method"
    category: "email_copywriting"
    origin: "Jon Benson - Email CopyPro"
    command: "*open-click-buy"

    philosophy: |
      The email must accomplish three things in sequence:
      Get OPENED (subject line), get CLICKED (body), get the SALE (landing page).
      Most copywriters focus only on the click.

    three_stages:
      - stage: "OPEN"
        element: "Subject Line"
        purpose: "Break through inbox noise"
        techniques:
          - "Curiosity gap (incomplete information)"
          - "Personal (use first name)"
          - "Conversational (lowercase, casual)"
          - "Pattern interrupt (unexpected)"
        dont_do:
          - "Clickbait that doesn't deliver"
          - "ALL CAPS SPAM STYLE"
          - "Vague promises"

          good: "that weird thing I mentioned..."
          bad: "AMAZING OFFER INSIDE!!!"

      - stage: "CLICK"
        element: "Email Body"
        purpose: "Drive them to take action"

          - "Conversational tone"
          - "Story-driven content"
          - "Natural link placement"
          - "Powerful P.S."

      - stage: "BUY"
        element: "Landing Page Congruence"
        purpose: "Deliver on email promise"
        techniques:
          - "Headline matches email promise"
          - "Same voice/tone"
          - "Clear value proposition"
          - "Easy action path"

    category: "engagement"
    origin: "Jon Benson - VSL Psychology"
    command: "*curiosity-hooks"

    definition: |
      Open loops of curiosity that can only be closed by continuing to watch/read.
      The human brain HATES open loops - it will stay engaged trying to close them.

    types:
      - type: "The Mystery"
        pattern: "In a moment, I'll reveal [thing], but first..."
        mechanism: "Delays gratification while promising it"

      - type: "The Tease"
        pattern: "There's one thing that made all the difference..."
        mechanism: "Implies specific knowledge without revealing"

      - type: "The Warning"
        pattern: "But before you try this, you MUST know..."
        mechanism: "Creates fear of missing critical information"

      - type: "The Contrast"
        pattern: "This is nothing like [what they've tried]..."
        mechanism: "Differentiates while building curiosity about how"

      - type: "The Insider"
        pattern: "What the [industry] doesn't want you to know..."
        mechanism: "Forbidden knowledge appeal"

    application: |
      Open 2-3 loops in the first minute of a VSL.
      Close them gradually throughout the presentation.
      Always close all loops before the CTA - don't leave them frustrated.

      The core story structure that shows CHANGE - the before and after,
      the journey between. This is the backbone of all effective VSLs.

    three_elements:
      - element: "Before State"
        purpose: "Create identification"
        instruction: |
          Paint a vivid picture of the problem state.
          Use specific details (numbers, emotions, situations).
          The prospect should think "That's exactly me!"
        example: |
          "At 38, I was 70 pounds overweight, in debt, and my doctor
          told me my arteries were 40% blocked. I was dying."

      - element: "Bridge (The Journey)"
        purpose: "Show the path"
        instruction: |
          Don't skip from problem to solution. Show the process.
          Include failures, discoveries, adjustments.
          Make it feel real and achievable.
        example: |
          "I tried everything. Diets, trainers, pills. Nothing worked
          until I accidentally discovered this one principle..."

      - element: "After State"
        purpose: "Show the promised land"
        instruction: |
          Be specific about results.
          Include emotional benefits, not just physical/financial.
          Make it aspirational but believable.
        example: |
          "Two years later, I had reversed the blockage, lost 70 pounds,
          and was competing in bodybuilding competitions at 40."

    the_offer_connection: |
      The transformation narrative naturally leads to the offer:
      "And now I want to help you achieve the same transformation."
      Your product is the VEHICLE for their transformation.

        purpose: "Present the answer to their problem"
        instruction: |
          Introduce your method/product as the discovery that changed everything.

        example: "That's when I discovered this one principle..."

      - phase: "ACTION"
        purpose: "Guide them to next step"
        instruction: |
          Clear, simple call to action.
