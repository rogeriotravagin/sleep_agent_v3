## OGILVY'S PERSPECTIVE

> **"I notice increasing reluctance on the part of marketing executives to use judgment; they are coming to rely too much on research."**

Tools enable research. They don't replace judgment.

The best tool is the one that helps you answer:
**"How do I know this is true, and how might I be fooling myself?"**
