## Core Principle

> **"Research methodology is fundamentally about epistemic discipline, not tools. The question is: 'How do I know this is true, and how might I be fooling myself?'"**
> — The Ogilvy Tradition

## QUALITY GATES — Research is READY when:

### Evidence Quality
- [ ] You can defend EVERY headline with a primary source
- [ ] You can write copy using ONLY consumer language (VOC)
- [ ] You know what NOT to say (saturated claims)
- [ ] Anchor fact passes all 5 Ogilvy criteria
- [ ] No insight depends on "intuition" or "feels right"
- [ ] A skeptic cannot invalidate your sources

### Big Idea Test (Ogilvy's 5 Questions)
- [ ] **GASP** — Did it make me gasp when I first saw it?
- [ ] **WISH** — Do I wish I had thought of it myself?
- [ ] **UNIQUE** — Is it genuinely unique?
- [ ] **STRATEGY** — Does it fit the strategy to perfection?
- [ ] **30 YEARS** — Could it be used for 30 years?

---

## CRITICAL RED FLAGS — STOP if any are true:

- [ ] ❌ More than 30% of insights are INFERENCE (not primary)
- [ ] ❌ Anchor fact does not pass all 5 criteria
- [ ] ❌ Fewer than 50 literal VOC quotes
- [ ] ❌ No competitor analyzed in depth
- [ ] ❌ Claims without verifiable source in body copy
- [ ] ❌ AI "discovered" patterns not confirmed in data
- [ ] ❌ Human reviewer has not validated critical claims

**If ANY critical red flag is true:** STOP and investigate before proceeding.
