"Get the reader's attention by addressing what's
already on their mind"

Part 2: THE DESIRE (Paint the Picture)
"Make them want what you're offering by showing
the transformation"

Part 3: THE PROOF (Remove Doubt)
"Prove your claims so they believe it's possible
for THEM"

Part 4: THE CLOSE (Make it Easy)
"Tell them exactly what to do and remove all
barriers to action"

## QUICK REFERENCE: The 4 Questions

```
Each section must answer ONE primary question:

HOOK:    "Why should I pay attention?"
         → Answer: "Because this is about YOU and YOUR situation"

DESIRE:  "What will I get?"
         → Answer: "You'll get [transformation] and feel [emotion]"

PROOF:   "Why should I believe you?"
         → Answer: "Because [testimonials], [stats], [guarantee]"

CLOSE:   "What do I do now?"
         → Answer: "Do [specific action] right now because [urgency]"
```

---

## RED FLAGS

```
STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS TO AVOID:

□ Hook talks about product first
  FIX: Lead with prospect's situation

□ Desire section is all features, no benefits
  FIX: Convert features to emotional outcomes

□ Proof section is weak or missing
  FIX: Add testimonials, stats, guarantees

□ Close has multiple CTAs
  FIX: One clear action only

□ Sections are out of order
  FIX: Restructure to Hook→Desire→Proof→Close

□ Transitions are jarring
  FIX: Add bridging sentences between sections
