# Create Unique Mechanism - Todd Brown E5 Method

## Purpose

Create a differentiated Unique Mechanism using Todd Brown's E5 Method framework. This task generates TWO mechanisms: the **Problem Mechanism** (why other approaches failed) and the **Solution Mechanism** (why yours works), plus a **Big Marketing Idea** that makes your offer impossible to ignore.

## When to Use

- **Before writing any copy** - This is foundational strategy
- When entering saturated markets (Stage 3+ sophistication)
- When competitors promise the same results
- When your "what" is commoditized and you need to differentiate by "how"
- When existing copy isn't converting despite good awareness match
- When launching new products or repositioning existing ones

## Todd Brown on Unique Mechanism

```
"People don't want better, they want different.
Often they feel that different IS better.

A Unique Selling Proposition is very rare today.
Unique Mechanism is about showing your prospect
a DIFFERENT WAY to produce the result.

The 'how' differentiates more than the 'what'.
If you can't articulate your Unique Mechanism,
you don't have one."

— Todd Brown, Marketing Funnel Automation

## Inputs

```yaml
required:
  - product_name: What you're selling
  - target_market: Who you're selling to
  - main_promise: Your primary benefit/result
  - awareness_level: From diagnose-awareness-level.md (1-5)
  - sophistication_stage: From diagnose-market-sophistication.md (1-5)

optional:
  - competitor_mechanisms: What mechanisms competitors use
  - failed_approaches: What your audience has tried that didn't work
  - product_features: List of features/components
  - origin_story: How you discovered/created this
  - scientific_backing: Research, studies, data
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Pre-Work Validation

Before creating mechanisms, validate you're at the right stage:

```
SOPHISTICATION CHECK:

□ Is your market at Stage 3 or higher?
  - Stage 1-2: Simple claims may work, mechanism optional
  - Stage 3+: Mechanism REQUIRED for differentiation

□ Have competitors already used mechanisms?
  - If YES: Your mechanism must be DIFFERENT, not just better
  - If NO: You have first-mover advantage

□ Do you have something genuinely unique?
  - Process, ingredient, discovery, origin, or contrarian approach
  - If nothing unique: Go back to research/product development

⚠️ WARNING: Don't manufacture fake mechanisms.
   They must be REAL and DEFENSIBLE.
```

### Step 2: Problem Mechanism Development

The Problem Mechanism explains WHY other approaches failed. This builds credibility and sets up your solution.

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PROBLEM MECHANISM DEVELOPMENT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PURPOSE: Explain why everything else has failed for your prospect.
This validates their past struggles and positions your solution.

QUESTION TO ANSWER:
"What is the REAL REASON my prospects haven't succeeded yet?"

DISCOVERY PROCESS:

1. LIST ALL COMMON APPROACHES in your market:
   □ What do most people/products recommend?
   □ What has your prospect already tried?
   □ What does conventional wisdom say?

2. IDENTIFY THE FLAW in each approach:
   □ Why does it fail?
   □ What does it miss?
   □ What hidden factor does it ignore?

3. FIND THE ROOT CAUSE:
   □ What's the ONE THING that explains all failures?
   □ Is it a missing element? Wrong approach? Hidden blocker?
   □ Can you name it specifically?

4. NAME THE PROBLEM MECHANISM:
   □ Give it a memorable, proprietary name
   □ Make it sound scientific/specific
   □ It should be something they've never heard of

EXAMPLES:

WEIGHT LOSS:
- Common approaches: Diet, exercise, willpower
- Why they fail: Ignore hormonal regulation
- Root cause: "Metabolic Adaptation Response"
- Problem Mechanism: "Your body's 'Survival Mode' that fights
  weight loss the harder you try"

BUSINESS:
- Common approaches: More content, more ads, more hustle
- Why they fail: Ignore conversion fundamentals
- Root cause: Messaging-market mismatch
- Problem Mechanism: "The Invisible Traffic Leak that wastes
  87% of your marketing budget"

FILL IN YOUR PROBLEM MECHANISM:

Common approaches in my market:
1. _______________________
2. _______________________
3. _______________________

Why they fail:
_______________________

Root cause:
_______________________

Problem Mechanism Name:
"The _______________________ [that/which] _______________________"
```

### Step 3: Solution Mechanism Development

The Solution Mechanism explains HOW your approach works differently.

DEVELOPMENT PROCESS:

1. EXAMINE your product/service:
   □ What makes it genuinely different?
   □ What's the core process/ingredient/approach?
   □ What do you do that others don't?

2. SELECT mechanism type:
   □ Which type best fits your differentiation?
   □ Can you combine types for stronger positioning?

3. NAME your mechanism:
   □ Use 3-4 words maximum
   □ Include number if possible (adds specificity)
   □ Make it proprietary (only YOU can use this name)
   □ Make it memorable and easy to say

4. EXPLAIN how it works:
   □ Simple enough for a 12-year-old to understand
   □ Scientific/logical enough to be credible
   □ Specific enough to be unique

FILL IN YOUR SOLUTION MECHANISM:

Mechanism Type: _______________________

What makes my solution unique:
_______________________

Solution Mechanism Name:
"The _______________________ [Method/System/Protocol/etc.]"

One-sentence explanation:
"It works by _______________________"
```

### Step 4: Mechanism Connection

Connect the Problem and Solution Mechanisms into a compelling narrative.

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MECHANISM CONNECTION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THE PATTERN:

"The reason [result] has been so hard is [Problem Mechanism].

But once you [address Problem Mechanism] using [Solution Mechanism],
[result] becomes almost automatic."

FILL IN:

The reason _______________________ has been so hard is
_______________________ [Problem Mechanism].

But once you _______________________ using
_______________________ [Solution Mechanism],
_______________________ becomes almost automatic.

EXAMPLE:

"The reason weight loss has been so hard is your body's
'Survival Mode Response' - it actually FIGHTS you the harder
you try to diet.

But once you deactivate this response using the 3-Phase
Metabolic Reset Protocol, fat burning becomes almost automatic
- your body finally WORKS WITH you instead of against you."

VALIDATION:

□ Does this clearly explain WHY they've struggled?
□ Does it position your solution as the ONLY logical answer?
□ Does it feel intellectually satisfying?
□ Would someone nod and say "That makes sense!"?
```

### Step 5: Big Marketing Idea Development

The Big Idea is the single concept that encapsulates your mechanisms and makes your offer impossible to ignore.

SCORING:
- 5/5 Pass = Strong Big Idea ✅ Proceed with confidence
- 4/5 Pass = Workable 🔄 Strengthen the weak criterion
- 3/5 or less = Weak ❌ Go back and dig deeper

BIG IDEA FORMULA:

E-C (P-P+U-M) I-I

Emotionally Compelling (Primary Promise + Unique Mechanism)
Intellectually Interesting

THE ONE-SENTENCE TEST:

Can you state your Big Idea in ONE sentence that includes:
- The Primary Promise (what they get)
- The Unique Mechanism (how they get it)
- Something Intellectually Interesting (the twist)
- Emotional Resonance (why they care)

Template:
"[Audience] can now [achieve result] by [unique mechanism],
even if [obstacle they believe prevents them]"

Example:
"Women over 40 can now lose stubborn belly fat by resetting their
body's 'Survival Mode' switch, even if diets have never worked
before—because the problem was never willpower, it was hormones."

FILL IN YOUR BIG IDEA:

One-Sentence Big Idea:
_______________________________________________________________

## Common Mistakes

```
MISTAKE 1: PROBLEM MECHANISM TOO VAGUE
- ❌ "The reason diets fail is they're hard"
- ✅ "The reason diets fail is the Metabolic Adaptation Response -
     your body's primitive survival mechanism that slows your
     metabolism the moment it senses calorie restriction"

MISTAKE 2: SOLUTION MECHANISM SOUNDS LIKE EVERYONE ELSE
- ❌ "Our proven weight loss system"
- ✅ "The Hormonal Reset Protocol that deactivates your body's
     fat-storing response at the cellular level"

MISTAKE 3: NO CONNECTION BETWEEN MECHANISMS
- ❌ Problem: "Diets are hard" / Solution: "Our easy program"
- ✅ Problem: "Your hormones fight weight loss" /
     Solution: "We reset those specific hormones"

MISTAKE 4: BIG IDEA HAS MULTIPLE CONCEPTS
- ❌ "Lose weight, build muscle, boost energy, and feel great
     with our revolutionary system"
- ✅ "Finally end the diet struggle by resetting the ONE hormone
     that controls whether you burn or store fat"

MISTAKE 5: MECHANISM ISN'T DEFENSIBLE
- ❌ Making up scientific-sounding nonsense
- ✅ Basing mechanism on real process, ingredient, or method
     that you can explain and prove
```

## Integration

- **Prerequisites**: diagnose-awareness-level.md, diagnose-market-sophistication.md
- **Used by**: create-headlines.md, create-sales-page.md, vsl-script.md, create-ad-copy.md
- **Related**: create-big-idea.md (standalone Big Idea task)
- **Checklists**: copy-quality-checklist.md
- **Agent**: @todd-brown (Tier 2 - Systematizers)

## Quick Reference

### The Two Questions

1. **Problem Mechanism:** "Why has everything else FAILED for them?"
2. **Solution Mechanism:** "Why does THIS approach WORK differently?"

### Big Idea Formula

**E-C (P-P+U-M) I-I**
- Emotionally Compelling
- Primary Promise + Unique Mechanism
- Intellectually Interesting

### The 75/25 Rule

- **75%** of your copy = Educating about the Unique Mechanism
- **25%** of your copy = Presenting the offer

### Todd Brown's Core Insight

> "Without a Big Idea, you're just another competitor making noise.
> People don't want better, they want DIFFERENT.
> The 'how' differentiates more than the 'what'.
> If you can't articulate your Unique Mechanism, you don't have one."
