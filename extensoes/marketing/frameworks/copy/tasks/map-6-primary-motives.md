# Map 6 Primary Motives - Collier Method

## Purpose

Identify which of the 6 Primary Motives drives your prospect's buying decision. This is the SECOND STEP in the Collier method, after analyzing the mental conversation.

## When to Use

- **After** analyze-mental-conversation.md
- Before writing any persuasive content
- When unclear which emotional driver dominates
- To prioritize appeal angles in copy
- When copy needs stronger emotional resonance

## Collier's 6 Primary Motives

```
THE 6 MOTIVES THAT DRIVE ALL HUMAN ACTION

Robert Collier identified that EVERY purchase, every decision,
every action humans take is driven by ONE of these 6 motives:

1. LOVE (for others)
2. GAIN (wealth, advantage)
3. DUTY (obligation, responsibility)
4. PRIDE (status, recognition)
5. SELF-INDULGENCE (pleasure, comfort)
6. SELF-PRESERVATION (safety, survival)

Your copy MUST appeal to the DOMINANT motive.
Secondary motives can strengthen, but ONE must lead.

### Step 3: Determine the Hierarchy

```
MOTIVE PRIORITIZATION MATRIX

List your ratings from Step 2:

1. ____________: ___/10 → PRIMARY MOTIVE
2. ____________: ___/10 → SECONDARY MOTIVE
3. ____________: ___/10 → SUPPORTING MOTIVE
4. ____________: ___/10
5. ____________: ___/10
6. ____________: ___/10

DOMINANT MOTIVE: ________________

MOTIVE COMBINATION:
Primary (70%): _____________
Secondary (20%): ___________
Supporting (10%): __________
```

### Step 4: Validate Against Product

```
PRODUCT-MOTIVE FIT ANALYSIS

Your Product: ________________
Dominant Motive Identified: ________________

FIT CHECK:
□ Does your product naturally solve a problem
  related to this motive?
□ Can you make genuine claims supporting this motive?
□ Do your best customers buy for this reason?
□ Does competitor research show this motive works?

If NO to any:
→ Re-examine your motive hierarchy
→ Consider if secondary motive has better fit
→ Adjust copy angle to match genuine fit

WARNING: Forcing a motive that doesn't fit creates
inauthentic copy that fails to convert.
```
