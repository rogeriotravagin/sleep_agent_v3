### Hopkins Core Principles

```yaml
principles:
  
  salesmanship_in_print:
    statement: "Advertising is salesmanship multiplied"
    implications:
      - "Same rules as face-to-face selling apply"
      - "If it wouldn't work spoken, don't write it"
      - "Every ad is a salesman calling on thousands"
  
  test_everything:
    statement: "Almost any question can be answered cheaply, quickly and finally by a test campaign"
    implications:
      - "Different headlines for different markets"
      - "Coupons to measure exact response"
      - "Never assume, always test"
      - "Data > Opinion"
  
  reason_why:
    statement: "Give specific reasons to buy"
    implications:
      - "Facts sell more than adjectives"
      - "'37.5% more efficient' > 'much better'"
      - "Specificity creates believability"
  
  results_only:
    statement: "The only purpose of advertising is to make sales"
    implications:
      - "No such thing as 'beautiful' copy that doesn't sell"
      - "Results are the only metric"
      - "Copywriter ego is irrelevant"
  
  tell_full_story:
    statement: "The more you tell, the more you sell"
    implications:
      - "Readers who engage are interested"
      - "Don't economize on information"
      - "Complete copy outsells short copy (for interested audience)"
```

  lead:
    - "Maintains headline promise?"
    - "Connects emotionally?"
    - "Leads to next section?"
  
  body:
    - "Uses specificity vs generalities?"
    - "Has proof for each claim?"
    - "Flows logically?"
    - "Answers objections?"
  
  offer:
    - "Clear and simple?"
    - "High perceived value?"
    - "Real urgency (not fake)?"

  cta:
    - "One clear action?"
    - "Easy to execute?"
    - "Repeated adequately?"
  
  general:
    - "Passes 'salesman test' (would work face-to-face)?"
    - "Each element testable?"
    - "Results measurable?"

  achievement: "Multiple long-running controls"

key_frameworks:
  - "5 Levels of Awareness"
  - "5 Stages of Market Sophistication"
  - "Mass Desire channeling"
```

### Schwartz Fundamental Principle

```yaml
core_principle:
  statement: "Copy cannot create desire. It can only take hopes, dreams, fears and desires that already exist in the hearts of millions of people, and focus those already-existing desires onto a particular product."
  
  implication:
    wrong: "Create desire for your product"
    right: "Channel existing desire toward your product"
    action: "Research what they already want, then show how your product delivers it"
```

### Five Levels of Awareness

```yaml
awareness_levels:
  description: "Determines copy LENGTH, APPROACH, and LEAD TYPE"
  
  level_1_unaware:
    name: "Unaware"
    prospect_state: "Doesn't know they have a problem"
    copy_approach: "Start with story or identification, not product"
    copy_length: "Very long (5000+ words)"
    lead_type: "Indirect - story, problem identification, big idea"
    example_opening: "You probably don't realize this, but 73% of people..."
    lead_clone: "Gary Halbert"
  
  level_2_problem_aware:
    name: "Problem Aware"
    prospect_state: "Knows problem, doesn't know solutions exist"
    copy_approach: "Agitate pain, show consequences, introduce solution category"
    copy_length: "Long (3000-5000 words)"
    lead_type: "Problem agitation"
    example_opening: "Tired of waking up exhausted every single day?"
    lead_clone: "Clayton Makepeace"
  
  level_3_solution_aware:
    name: "Solution Aware"
    prospect_state: "Knows solutions exist, doesn't know your product"
    copy_approach: "Differentiate with unique mechanism"
    copy_length: "Medium (1500-3000 words)"
    lead_type: "Mechanism/differentiation"
    example_opening: "There's a new method that works differently..."
    lead_clone: "Todd Brown"
  
  level_4_product_aware:
    name: "Product Aware"
    prospect_state: "Knows your product, hasn't bought yet"
    copy_approach: "Break objections, stack value, add proof"
    copy_length: "Medium-short (800-1500 words)"
    lead_type: "Proof and offer enhancement"
    example_opening: "Here's what changed in version 2.0..."
    lead_clone: "Gary Bencivenga"
  
  level_5_most_aware:
    name: "Most Aware"
    prospect_state: "Knows everything, just needs offer/push"
    copy_approach: "Direct offer, urgency, deal"
    copy_length: "Short (300-800 words)"
    lead_type: "Direct offer"
    example_opening: "50% off today only. Click here."
    lead_clone: "John Carlton"

golden_rule:
  statement: "The LESS aware the market, the MORE copy you need. The MORE aware, the LESS copy needed."
  inverse: "Long copy for cold traffic, short copy for hot traffic"
```

### Five Stages of Market Sophistication

```yaml
sophistication_stages:
  description: "Determines WHAT TYPE of claim will work"
  
  stage_1_virgin:
    name: "Virgin Market"
    market_state: "No competitors, you're first"
    strategy: "Be first. Make direct claim."
    claim_type: "Simple promise"
    example: "Lose weight!"
  
  stage_2_competition:
    name: "Competition Enters"
    market_state: "Others making similar claims"
    strategy: "Amplify the claim. Be more specific."
    claim_type: "Bigger/better promise"
    example: "Lose 10kg in 30 days!"
  
  stage_3_saturated:
    name: "Saturated Claims"
    market_state: "Everyone making big promises"
    strategy: "Introduce UNIQUE MECHANISM. Explain HOW."
    claim_type: "Mechanism-based differentiation"
    example: "The X Method that melts fat while you sleep"
    note: "This is where Todd Brown's work applies"
  
  stage_4_mechanisms_exhausted:
    name: "Mechanisms Exhausted"
    market_state: "Many mechanisms already claimed"
    strategy: "Amplify mechanism. Make more specific/scientific."
    claim_type: "Enhanced/scientific mechanism"
    example: "The XYZ enzyme discovered at Harvard..."
  
  stage_5_skeptical:
    name: "Skeptical Market"
    market_state: "They've heard it all, trust nothing"
    strategy: "Identification > Promise. Focus on THEM, not product."
    claim_type: "Prospect identification"
    example: "If you're like me, you've tried everything..."

application_rule: "Diagnose sophistication BEFORE writing claims. Wrong stage = wrong approach = failure."
```

### Schwartz Use Cases

```yaml
when_to_use:
  - context: "ALWAYS FIRST"
    reason: "Without awareness + sophistication diagnosis, everything else is guesswork"
  
  - context: "Initial campaign diagnosis"
    action: "Map awareness level of target audience"
  
  - context: "Defining copy length and tone"
    action: "Awareness level determines this"
  
  - context: "Choosing headline type"
    action: "Match to awareness level"
  
  - context: "Structuring VSL or sales page"
    action: "Lead type follows awareness"
  
  - context: "Segmenting email list"
    action: "Different awareness = different sequences"
  
  - context: "Deciding if unique mechanism needed"
    action: "Sophistication stage 3+ requires mechanism"
