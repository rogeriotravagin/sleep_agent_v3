## 1. What is a Framework?

### 1.1 Definition of an Operational Framework

An operational framework is a repeatable system or methodology that produces consistent results when applied to similar situations. It consists of:

**Core Elements:**
1. **Named Components:** Distinct parts that work together
2. **Clear Steps:** A process that can be followed
3. **Defined Outcomes:** What the framework produces
4. **Applicability Triggers:** When to use it
5. **Transferability:** Can be taught and replicated

**The Framework Formula:**
```
Framework = Named System + Structured Process + Repeatable Results
```

### 1.2 Framework vs. Advice vs. Opinion

Understanding what qualifies as a framework is critical:

**IS a Framework:**
```yaml
characteristics:
  - Has explicit or implied name
  - Contains distinct steps or components
  - Can be replicated by someone else
  - Solves a specific, recurring problem
  - Produces consistent results when applied
  - Appears multiple times or is emphasized as core methodology

examples:
  - "The AIDA Formula" (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action)
  - "The Value Ladder" (progression of offers)
  - "The Dream 100 Method" (targeting high-value prospects)
```

**IS NOT a Framework:**
```yaml
not_framework:
  general_advice:
    example: "Write good headlines"
    why_not: "No structure, no steps, not replicable"

  one_off_examples:
    example: "I once wrote a headline that got 40% CTR"
    why_not: "Specific instance without methodology"

  opinions_without_structure:
    example: "I think long copy is better"
    why_not: "Personal preference, not systematic approach"

  personal_preferences:
    example: "I always write in the morning"
    why_not: "Habit, not transferable methodology"
```

### 1.3 The Framework Spectrum

Frameworks exist on a spectrum from implicit to explicit:

```
Implicit ←────────────────────────────────→ Explicit
   │                                           │
   │  - Repeated patterns                      │  - Named systems
   │  - Consistent structure                   │  - Numbered steps
   │  - Observable methodology                 │  - Documented process
   │  - Must be extracted                      │  - Clearly taught
   │                                           │
   └───────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Implicit Frameworks:**
- Not named but consistently applied
- Must be identified through pattern recognition
- Often the most valuable (unique to the copywriter)

**Explicit Frameworks:**
- Clearly named and taught
- Usually have acronyms or memorable titles
- Easier to extract but may be shared with others

### 1.4 Framework Value Hierarchy

Not all frameworks are equally valuable. Rank by:

```yaml
framework_value_hierarchy:
  tier_1_signature:
    description: "Frameworks unique to this copywriter"
    value: "Highest - defines their methodology"
    characteristics:
      - Coined by them
      - Central to their teaching
      - What they're known for

  tier_2_adapted:
    description: "Standard frameworks with their unique twist"
    value: "High - shows their approach"
    characteristics:
      - Based on known frameworks
      - Modified with their experience
      - Applied in distinctive way

  tier_3_applied:
    description: "Standard frameworks they use consistently"
    value: "Medium - shows tool selection"
    characteristics:
      - Industry-standard frameworks
      - Part of their toolkit
      - May have minor variations

  tier_4_referenced:
    description: "Frameworks they mention but don't emphasize"
    value: "Lower - contextual only"
    characteristics:
      - Mentioned for completeness
      - Not central to methodology
      - May cite others' work
```

## 2. Pattern Recognition Theory

### 2.1 Identifying Recurring Structures

Framework extraction requires recognizing patterns across content:

**Pattern Recognition Process:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Step 1: Read source materials completely                │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Step 2: Note repeated structures and sequences          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Step 3: Identify named systems and acronyms             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Step 4: Map implicit patterns to explicit structures    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Step 5: Validate patterns across multiple sources       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2.2 Framework Signal Detection

**Strong Signals (High Confidence):**
```yaml
strong_signals:
  naming:
    - "I call this the [X] Method"
    - "This is my [X] Framework"
    - "The [X] Formula works like this"

  numbering:
    - "The 5 steps to..."
    - "These 3 components..."
    - "The 7 laws of..."

  acronyms:
    - "PASTOR stands for..."
    - "Using AIDA..."
    - "My STAR method..."

  emphasis:
    - "This is the most important thing I teach"
    - "Everything I do comes back to this"
    - "If you only remember one thing..."
```

**Medium Signals (Requires Validation):**
```yaml
medium_signals:
  repeated_sequences:
    - Same steps mentioned across multiple sources
    - Consistent order of operations
    - Similar structure in different contexts

  teaching_patterns:
    - "First... then... finally..."
    - "The key components are..."
    - "You need to understand these elements..."

  problem_solution_patterns:
    - "When you face [X], do [Y]"
    - "The solution to [X] is always [Y]"
```

**Weak Signals (Needs Context):**
```yaml
weak_signals:
  general_recommendations:
    - "You should..."
    - "It's best to..."
    - "Consider..."

  single_mentions:
    - One-time advice
    - Context-specific suggestions
    - Ad hoc recommendations
```

### 2.3 Implicit Framework Identification

Many valuable frameworks are implicit—used consistently but never named:

**Implicit Framework Extraction Process:**

1. **Pattern Observation:**
   - Track how they solve recurring problems
   - Note consistent sequences of actions
   - Identify repeated structural elements

2. **Structure Mapping:**
   - Document the steps they consistently follow
   - Identify the components always present
   - Map the decision points

3. **Name Synthesis:**
   - Create a descriptive name based on function
   - Use their vocabulary if possible
   - Make it memorable and accurate

4. **Validation:**
   - Verify pattern appears across multiple sources
   - Confirm structure is consistent
   - Test if it can be taught independently

### 2.4 Cross-Source Pattern Validation

A true framework should be validated across multiple sources:

**Validation Matrix:**

| Framework | Source 1 | Source 2 | Source 3 | Consistency | Status |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------|-------------|--------|
| [Name] | Mentioned | Applied | Taught | High | Confirmed |
| [Name] | Mentioned | - | Referenced | Medium | Probable |
| [Name] | Mentioned | - | - | Low | Needs more evidence |

## 3. Knowledge Extraction Methodologies

### 3.1 Expert Knowledge Elicitation

Framework extraction draws from knowledge management theory:

**Knowledge Types:**
```yaml
knowledge_types:
  explicit_knowledge:
    description: "Formally documented, easily transferred"
    extraction_method: "Direct capture from stated frameworks"
    sources: "Books, courses, documented methodologies"

  tacit_knowledge:
    description: "Embedded in practice, hard to articulate"
    extraction_method: "Pattern recognition from applications"
    sources: "Examples, case studies, actual work"

  implicit_knowledge:
    description: "Underlying assumptions and mental models"
    extraction_method: "Inference from consistent behavior"
    sources: "Decision patterns, priorities, approaches"
```

### 3.2 Structured Extraction Protocol

**Phase-Based Extraction:**

```yaml
extraction_phases:
  phase_1_immersion:
    objective: "Complete understanding of all source materials"
    activities:
      - Read every source document completely
      - Note initial framework signals
      - Create source catalog with quality ratings

  phase_2_identification:
    objective: "Find all potential frameworks"
    activities:
      - List explicit frameworks (named)
      - List implicit frameworks (patterns)
      - Preliminary categorization

  phase_3_validation:
    objective: "Confirm frameworks meet criteria"
    activities:
      - Cross-reference across sources
      - Verify structure completeness
      - Test transferability

  phase_4_documentation:
    objective: "Complete framework capture"
    activities:
      - Full structure documentation
      - Example collection
      - Application guide creation

  phase_5_synthesis:
    objective: "Integrate into coherent system"
    activities:
      - Ensure category coverage
      - Check for overlaps
      - Final quality validation
```

### 3.3 Source Material Analysis

Different source types yield different framework insights:

**Source Type Analysis:**

| Source Type | Framework Signal Strength | Extraction Focus |
|-------------|--------------------------|------------------|
| Books | High (explicit teaching) | Named frameworks, complete structures |
| Courses | High (systematic teaching) | Step-by-step processes, applications |
| Interviews | Medium (explanatory) | Philosophy, implicit frameworks |
| Podcasts | Medium (conversational) | Real applications, adaptations |
| Articles | Medium (focused) | Specific frameworks for specific problems |
| Social posts | Low (fragments) | Components, principles, hints |
| Sales pages | Medium (applied) | Frameworks in action |

### 3.4 Depth vs. Breadth Balance

Framework extraction requires balancing:

**Depth:** Complete documentation of each framework
- All components identified
- Full process documented
- Examples collected
- Mistakes noted

**Breadth:** Coverage of different framework categories
- Copywriting frameworks
- Marketing strategy
- Sales processes
- Content creation
- Mindset/psychology

**The 10-Framework Standard:**
10 frameworks provides sufficient:
- Coverage across categories
- Depth of documentation
- Manageability for application
- Distinctiveness capture

---

## 4. Framework Taxonomy and Classification

### 4.1 The Copywriter Framework Categories

Frameworks cluster into distinct categories based on the problems they solve:

**Category Taxonomy:**

```yaml
framework_categories:
  copywriting:
    description: "Writing techniques, formulas, structures"
    subcategories:
      - Headlines and hooks
      - Body copy structure
      - Calls to action
      - Story frameworks
    examples: ["PASTOR", "PAS", "AIDA", "FAB"]

  offer_creation:
    description: "Building offers, pricing, bundling"
    subcategories:
      - Value stacking
      - Pricing psychology
      - Bundle design
      - Guarantee frameworks
    examples: ["Value Ladder", "Godfather Offer", "Risk Reversal"]

  marketing_strategy:
    description: "Overall marketing approach, positioning"
    subcategories:
      - Positioning
      - Differentiation
      - Channel strategy
      - Campaign structure
    examples: ["Category Design", "Content Pyramid", "Omnipresence"]

  sales:
    description: "Sales processes, objection handling"
    subcategories:
      - Sales scripts
      - Objection handling
      - Closing techniques
      - Follow-up systems
    examples: ["SPIN Selling", "Challenger Sale", "Question Framework"]

  content:
    description: "Content creation, distribution"
    subcategories:
      - Content formats
      - Publishing rhythms
      - Repurposing
      - Distribution
    examples: ["Content Wheel", "Newsletter Framework", "Social Stacking"]

  audience:
    description: "Avatar, targeting, segmentation"
    subcategories:
      - Avatar development
      - Targeting methods
      - Segmentation
      - Research frameworks
    examples: ["Dream 100", "Avatar Deep Dive", "Market Sophistication"]

  product:
    description: "Product development, improvement"
    subcategories:
      - MVP frameworks
      - Product improvement
      - Feature prioritization
      - Product-market fit
    examples: ["Minimum Viable Offer", "Product Pyramid"]

  mindset:
    description: "Beliefs, psychology, personal development"
    subcategories:
      - Success mindset
      - Fear handling
      - Identity work
      - Performance optimization
    examples: ["Identity Shift", "Abundance Mindset", "Fear Setting"]
```

### 4.2 Category Distribution Guidelines

For comprehensive coverage, aim for:

**Recommended Distribution:**
```yaml
category_distribution:
  copywriting: 2-3 frameworks
  offer_creation: 1-2 frameworks
  marketing_strategy: 1-2 frameworks
  sales: 1-2 frameworks
  content: 1-2 frameworks
  audience: 0-1 frameworks
  product: 0-1 frameworks
  mindset: 0-1 frameworks

  rules:
    minimum_categories: 4
    maximum_per_category: 3
    total_frameworks: 10
```

### 4.3 Cross-Category Frameworks

Some frameworks span multiple categories:

**Multi-Category Framework Handling:**
```yaml
cross_category_rules:
  assignment:
    - Assign to PRIMARY category (main problem it solves)
    - Note secondary applications in documentation
    - Don't duplicate across categories

  example:
    framework: "The Value Ladder"
    primary: offer_creation
    secondary: [marketing_strategy, sales]
    note: "Assigned to offer_creation as core function is offer structuring"
```

## 5. Documentation Standards

### 5.1 Framework Documentation Structure

Every framework must be documented with consistent structure:

**Complete Framework Documentation:**

```yaml
framework_documentation_standard:
  identification:
    name: "Clear, memorable name"
    category: "Primary category from taxonomy"
    origin: "Where first documented/taught"

  explanation:
    definition: "2-4 sentences explaining what and when"
    principle: "One-sentence core principle"

  structure:
    components:
      description: "Overview of parts"
      parts: "List of named components with descriptions"

  execution:
    process:
      description: "How to execute"
      steps: "Numbered steps with actions"

  application:
    when: "Triggers for using framework"
    process: "Application steps"
    expected_outcome: "What success looks like"

  warnings:
    common_mistakes: "3+ mistakes people make"

  evidence:
    examples: "Real applications with context and results"
```

### 5.2 Definition Writing Standards

Framework definitions must be:

**Definition Criteria:**
```yaml
definition_standards:
  length: "2-4 sentences"
  content:
    - What the framework does
    - When to use it
    - What problem it solves
  voice: "Use copywriter's language where possible"
  clarity: "Understandable without prior context"

  good_example: >
    The PASTOR Framework is a six-part copywriting formula that guides readers
    through a journey from problem awareness to purchase. Use it for long-form
    sales pages, webinar presentations, or email sequences where you need to
    build emotional resonance before presenting the solution.

  bad_example: >
    A copywriting formula.
```

### 5.3 Component Documentation

Each component needs clear documentation:

**Component Standards:**
```yaml
component_documentation:
  required_fields:
    - name: "Component name"
    - description: "What it does"
    - role: "How it fits in the whole"

  optional_fields:
    - examples: "Real applications"
    - variations: "Different versions"
    - common_errors: "What goes wrong"

  format_example:
    - name: "Problem (P in PASTOR)"
      description: "Identify and articulate the reader's core problem"
      role: "Opens the piece by creating resonance"
      example: "Are you tired of writing content that gets ignored?"
```

### 5.4 Process Documentation

Steps must be actionable and complete:

**Process Standards:**
```yaml
process_documentation:
  step_format:
    - step_number: "Sequential number"
    - name: "Brief name for step"
    - action: "What to do"
    - outcome: "What completing this step produces"

  requirements:
    - Minimum 3 steps
    - Maximum 10 steps
    - Each step actionable
    - Clear sequence
    - Logical progression

  example:
    - step: 1
      name: "Problem Research"
      action: "Interview 10 customers about their biggest struggle"
      outcome: "List of pain points in customer language"

    - step: 2
      name: "Agitation Mapping"
      action: "For each pain point, write 3 consequences of not solving"
      outcome: "Emotional connection to urgency"
```

### 5.5 Example Documentation

Examples provide proof and clarity:

**Example Standards:**
```yaml
example_documentation:
  required_fields:
    context: "Situation where framework was applied"
    application: "How the framework was used"
    result: "What happened"

  quality_criteria:
    - Specific (not generic)
    - From copywriter's work (not hypothetical)
    - Complete (shows cause and effect)

  good_example:
    context: "Launching a new course on copywriting"
    application: "Used PASTOR in the sales page with problem section focused on 'invisible content syndrome'"
    result: "$127,000 in sales in first 48 hours"

  bad_example:
    context: "Marketing campaign"
    application: "Used the framework"
    result: "It worked"
```

---

## 6. Validation and Quality Assurance

### 6.1 Framework Quality Gates

Every framework must pass quality checks:

**Gate 1: Existence Validation**
```yaml
gate_1:
  checks:
    - Framework actually exists in source materials
    - Not fabricated or over-interpreted
    - Has sufficient evidence (multiple mentions or deep explanation)
```

**Gate 2: Completeness Validation**
```yaml
gate_2:
  checks:
    - All required fields populated
    - No placeholder text remaining
    - Components fully documented
    - Process steps complete
    - At least one example
```

**Gate 3: Accuracy Validation**
```yaml
gate_3:
  checks:
    - Definition matches copywriter's intent
    - Components correctly captured
    - Process steps in right order
    - Examples are real (not fabricated)
```

**Gate 4: Distinctiveness Validation**
```yaml
gate_4:
  checks:
    - Framework is unique (not duplicate of another)
    - Specific to this copywriter (not generic industry knowledge)
    - Adds value beyond common knowledge
```

**Gate 5: Usability Validation**
```yaml
gate_5:
  checks:
    - Could someone apply this framework from documentation?
    - Steps are actionable
    - Enough detail to execute
    - Examples clarify application
```

### 6.2 Cross-Framework Validation

Check the complete framework set:

**Set-Level Validation:**
```yaml
set_validation:
  count: "Exactly 10 frameworks"
  distribution: "At least 4 categories covered"
  balance: "No category has more than 3 frameworks"
  uniqueness: "No overlapping frameworks"
  coverage: "Major aspects of copywriter's methodology represented"
```

### 6.3 Voice Consistency Validation

Frameworks should sound like the copywriter:

**Voice Checks:**
```yaml
voice_validation:
  vocabulary:
    - Uses copywriter's terminology
    - Avoids words they wouldn't use
    - Framework names match their style

  philosophy:
    - Principles align with their worldview
    - Approaches match their methodology
    - Examples reflect their work

  tone:
    - Documentation tone matches their style
    - Teaching style consistent with their approach
```

## 7. Common Extraction Pitfalls

### 7.1 Over-Extraction

**Problem:** Finding frameworks that don't really exist

```yaml
over_extraction:
  symptoms:
    - Framework has only one mention
    - Structure is vague or incomplete
    - Must "fill in" missing pieces
    - Framework feels forced

  causes:
    - Pressure to find 10 frameworks
    - Interpreting advice as framework
    - Over-reading patterns

  solutions:
    - Require multiple source mentions
    - Ensure structure is complete in sources
    - Distinguish framework from advice
```

### 7.2 Under-Extraction

**Problem:** Missing implicit frameworks

```yaml
under_extraction:
  symptoms:
    - Only capturing named frameworks
    - Missing consistent patterns
    - Overlooking repeated methodologies

  causes:
    - Only looking for explicit signals
    - Not reading complete sources
    - Surface-level analysis

  solutions:
    - Track repeated structures
    - Read sources completely
    - Identify implicit patterns
```

### 7.3 Misattribution

**Problem:** Attributing generic frameworks as unique

```yaml
misattribution:
  symptoms:
    - Framework is common industry knowledge
    - Multiple copywriters use the same framework
    - Framework originated elsewhere

  causes:
    - Not checking framework origins
    - Assuming all mentioned frameworks are theirs
    - Not researching standard frameworks

  solutions:
    - Research framework origins
    - Note if they adapted or originated
    - Document unique modifications
```

### 7.4 Incomplete Documentation

**Problem:** Framework captured but not fully documented

```yaml
incomplete_documentation:
  symptoms:
    - Missing components
    - Vague process steps
    - No examples
    - Generic definitions

  causes:
    - Rushing documentation
    - Not re-reading sources for details
    - Assumptions without verification

  solutions:
    - Complete all required fields
    - Return to sources for details
    - Use specific language from sources
```

### 7.5 Category Imbalance

**Problem:** Too many frameworks in one category

```yaml
category_imbalance:
  symptoms:
    - 5+ frameworks in single category
    - Missing major categories
    - Narrow representation

  causes:
    - Copywriter specializes in one area
    - Extractor's bias
    - Incomplete source analysis

  solutions:
    - Enforce distribution guidelines
    - Search specifically for underrepresented categories
    - Combine similar frameworks if necessary
```

## 8. Framework Integration

### 8.1 Framework Relationships

Frameworks don't exist in isolation—they connect:

**Relationship Types:**
```yaml
framework_relationships:
  sequential:
    description: "One framework leads to another"
    example: "Avatar Framework → PASTOR Framework"
    documentation: "Note in application section"

  complementary:
    description: "Frameworks work together"
    example: "Value Ladder + Risk Reversal"
    documentation: "Note in application section"

  nested:
    description: "One framework contains another"
    example: "Content System contains Newsletter Framework"
    documentation: "Note in components section"

  alternative:
    description: "Frameworks for same problem"
    example: "PASTOR vs. PAS for sales copy"
    documentation: "Note in when_to_use section"
```

### 8.2 Framework System View

Understand how frameworks create a complete system:

**System Integration:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    COPYWRITER'S SYSTEM                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Audience    →    Offer      →    Copy       →    Sales     │
│  Frameworks       Frameworks      Frameworks      Frameworks │
│     │                │                │              │       │
│     └────────────────┴────────────────┴──────────────┘       │
│                            │                                 │
│              Mindset & Strategy Frameworks                   │
│              (underlying all activities)                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 8.3 Integration Documentation

Document how frameworks connect:

```yaml
integration_documentation:
  framework_name: "PASTOR"
  integrates_with:
    before:
      - name: "Avatar Deep Dive"
        relationship: "Provides audience insights for Problem section"
    during:
      - name: "Story Framework"
        relationship: "Used within Transformation section"
    after:
      - name: "Risk Reversal"
        relationship: "Applied in Solution/Action sections"
```

### 10.1 Complete Extraction Workflow

**Step-by-Step Protocol:**

```yaml
extraction_workflow:
  day_1_immersion:
    - Gather all source materials
    - Catalog sources by type and quality
    - First complete reading pass
    - Initial framework signal notes

  day_2_identification:
    - Second reading focused on frameworks
    - List all explicit frameworks
    - List all implicit patterns
    - Preliminary categorization

  day_3_selection:
    - Rank frameworks by value and evidence
    - Apply category distribution
    - Select final 10 frameworks
    - Validate selection criteria

  day_4_documentation:
    - Document frameworks 1-5 completely
    - Return to sources for details
    - Collect examples

  day_5_completion:
    - Document frameworks 6-10
    - Cross-validate all frameworks
    - Integration documentation
    - Final quality gates
```

### 10.2 Quality Standards Summary

**Minimum Requirements:**
```yaml
minimum_standards:
  frameworks: 10 (exactly)
  categories: 4+ different
  per_framework:
    definition: "2-4 sentences"
    principle: "1 sentence"
    components: "3-7 parts"
    steps: "3-7 steps"
    examples: "1+ with context and result"
    mistakes: "3+ items"
```

### 10.3 Output Specification

**Final Deliverable:**
```yaml
output_specification:
  format: "YAML"
  location: "outputs/minds/{slug}/analysis/frameworks.yaml"
  structure:
    - metadata (copywriter, date, counts)
    - categories_covered (distribution)
    - operational_frameworks (10 complete frameworks)
  validation:
    - YAML syntax valid
    - All fields populated
    - Quality gates passed
```

## Key Insights for Implementation

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Complete Source Reading:** Skim nothing—frameworks hide in details

2. **Pattern Recognition Over Signal:** Many valuable frameworks are implicit

3. **Voice Preservation:** Documentation should sound like the copywriter

4. **Category Balance:** Ensure coverage across methodology areas

5. **Evidence Requirement:** Every framework needs source evidence

### Implementation Priorities

1. **Quality Over Speed:** Better to have 10 excellent frameworks than rush

2. **Distinctiveness:** Prioritize what makes this copywriter unique

3. **Completeness:** Every field filled, no placeholders

4. **Usability:** Someone should be able to apply the framework from documentation
