# Order Bump Methodology Research
## Deep Research for Copy Framework v2.0

**Research Date:** 2026-01-23
**Purpose:** Foundation for create-order-bump.md upgrade
**Target:** 500+ lines of actionable research

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Order bumps are pre-checkout offers for complementary products that appear directly on the checkout page. They leverage the buyer's existing commitment momentum to increase Average Order Value (AOV) by 10-30% with minimal friction.

**Key Insight:** Order bumps are the "sneakiest, friendliest little sales ninja in your funnel" - a tiny checkbox that whispers "Hey, wouldn't you like fries with that?" at the perfect psychological moment.

**Core Principle:** An order bump should make the customer's life easier, faster, or better - NOT trick them into buying something they don't need.

## 2. Order Bump vs Other Funnel Offers

### 2.1 Comparison Matrix

| Element | Order Bump | Upsell (OTO) | Cross-Sell | Downsell |
|---------|-----------|--------------|------------|----------|
| **Timing** | On checkout page | After purchase | During browsing | After rejection |
| **Format** | Checkbox add-on | Separate page | Product suggestions | Alternative offer |
| **Friction** | One-click (lowest) | Button click | Browse/decide | Consider new offer |
| **Price** | 10-25% of main | 50-200% of main | Varies | Lower than declined |
| **Purpose** | Complement main | Premium upgrade | Related products | Salvage sale |
| **Psychology** | Impulse/momentum | Upgrade desire | Discovery | Price objection |

### 2.2 Why Order Bumps Work Best

1. **Lowest Friction:** Single checkbox vs entire decision process
2. **Peak Buying Mood:** Customer already committed to purchase
3. **Integrated Experience:** Doesn't interrupt checkout flow
4. **Low Price Point:** Easy impulse decision
5. **Complementary Value:** Enhances rather than competes

---

## 3. The Three Psychological Triggers

### 3.1 Trigger 1: The "No-Brainer" Effect

**Principle:** Make the order bump so obviously valuable that it requires zero deliberation.

**Characteristics:**
- Stupidly obvious to grab
- Directly complements primary purchase
- Low enough price for impulse
- Clear, immediate benefit

**Example:**
A picnic table seller bundles:
- Dispensers
- Shakers
- Tablecloths

These items naturally enhance the main product without requiring justification.

**Copy Application:**
```markdown
"Add the [Complement] that makes [Main Product] even better"

NOT: "You might also like this unrelated thing..."
```

**Benchmark:** 20-40% take rate when truly "no-brainer"

### 3.2 Trigger 2: Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)

**Principle:** Leverage urgency and exclusivity to create action.

**Key Insight:** "Once someone says yes, it gets easier to say yes again."

**FOMO Tactics for Order Bumps:**
1. **Limited-time pricing:** "This price only available at checkout"
2. **Price escalation:** "Normally $97, today only $27"
3. **Exclusive access:** "Only available when buying [Main Product]"
4. **Scarcity signals:** "87% of customers add this"

**Copy Application:**
```markdown
"This offer disappears after checkout"
"Exclusive bundle price — not available anywhere else"
"Join the 85% of customers who grab this"
```

**Important:** Create perceived scarcity WITHOUT feeling manipulative.

### 3.3 Trigger 3: Tiny Yes Momentum

**Principle:** Capitalize on the buyer's already-committed mental state.

**Psychology:** Since customers are already:
- Pulling out their wallets
- In a "yes" mindset
- Committed to the purchase
- Past major decision threshold

A small, low-risk add-on feels like a natural progression, not a new decision.

**Key Requirements:**
- Keep bump simple
- Keep bump affordable
- Directly tie to primary purchase
- Require zero additional justification

**Copy Application:**
```markdown
"Since you're already getting [Main], add [Bump] for just $X more"
"Complete your purchase with [Bump]"
"The perfect companion to [Main Product]"
```

---

## 4. Impulse Purchase Psychology

### 4.1 The Four Types of Impulse Buying

Understanding impulse buying types helps craft better order bumps:

#### Type 1: Pure Impulse
- "Escape purchase"
- Generated by product attractiveness alone
- No prior consideration
- Novelty-driven

**Order Bump Application:** Eye-catching visual, unique offer

#### Type 2: Reminder Impulse
- Sees product, remembers need
- "Oh, I've been meaning to get that"
- Prior awareness exists

**Order Bump Application:** "Complete your setup with [item you probably need]"

#### Type 3: Suggestion Impulse
- First time seeing product
- Immediately recognizes need
- No prior purchase history

**Order Bump Application:** "Customers who bought [Main] found [Bump] essential"

#### Type 4: Planned Impulse
- Enters with intention to buy something extra
- Looking for deals/offers
- Receptive to add-ons

**Order Bump Application:** Clear value proposition, obvious savings

### 4.2 Impulse Purchase Statistics

**Data Point (2024):** 89% of Americans admit to impulse buying, with 36% saying most of their purchases were unplanned.

**Implication:** The opportunity for well-designed order bumps is enormous.

### 4.3 What Drives Impulse Decisions

1. **Emotion over logic:** Impulse buys are feeling-based
2. **Immediate satisfaction:** "I want it now" mentality
3. **Brain reward system:** Dopamine hit from "getting a deal"
4. **Decision fatigue avoidance:** Simple = yes, complex = skip

## 5. Pricing Psychology for Order Bumps

### 5.1 The Golden Rule: 10-25% of Main Product

| Main Product Price | Ideal Bump Range | Sweet Spot |
|-------------------|------------------|------------|
| $27-$47 | $5-$12 | $7 |
| $97-$147 | $17-$37 | $27 |
| $197-$297 | $27-$67 | $47 |
| $497-$697 | $47-$127 | $97 |
| $997-$1,497 | $97-$247 | $147 |
| $1,997+ | $197-$397 | $297 |

### 5.2 Price Anchoring Strategies

**Strategy 1: Show Original Value**
```markdown
"Usually $97 — yours for just $27 today"
Savings highlighted: 72% OFF
```

**Strategy 2: Daily Cost Breakdown**
```markdown
"Just $27 — that's less than $1 per day for a month"
```

**Strategy 3: Per-Use Value**
```markdown
"$47 for unlimited use = pennies per [use case]"
```

**Strategy 4: Comparison Anchor**
```markdown
"The same templates agencies charge $500 to create"
```

### 5.3 Why Low Price Beats High Value

**Counterintuitive Finding:** Sometimes lowering the bump price INCREASES total revenue.

**Example:**
- Bump at $97: 15% take rate = $14.55/order
- Bump at $47: 35% take rate = $16.45/order

**Principle:** Accessibility often beats margin at checkout.

### 5.4 Price Testing Priority

Test in this order:
1. $X vs $X+$10 (small increment)
2. $X vs $X-$10 (lower price)
3. $X vs $X+$20 (larger increment)

## 8. Placement and Design

### 8.1 Optimal Placement

**Position:** Immediately above the payment/submit button

**Why This Works:**
- Last thing seen before committing
- Part of the decision "moment"
- Doesn't interrupt information gathering
- Natural add-on position

**Visual Flow:**
```
[Order Summary]
     ↓
[ORDER BUMP BOX]
     ↓
[Payment Information]
     ↓
[Complete Purchase Button]
```

### 8.2 Design Principles

**DO:**
- Make checkbox large and clickable
- Use subtle highlight (colored border or background)
- Keep consistent with page design
- Ensure mobile-friendly (thumb-sized)
- Make it noticeable but not aggressive

**DON'T:**
- Make it look like spam
- Hide it or make it too small
- Use aggressive colors that clash
- Require scrolling to see it
- Make checkbox tiny on mobile

### 8.3 Visual Elements

**Checkbox:**
- Large enough for easy clicking
- Clear checked/unchecked states
- Satisfying interaction (visual feedback)

**Container:**
- Subtle border or background
- Distinguishes from order summary
- Looks "special" without being spammy

**Product Image (Optional):**
- Small, clean mockup
- Shows what they're getting
- Doesn't overwhelm text

**Problem:** Unprofitable bump
**Solution:** Test higher prices before assuming low is best

### 11.3 Copy Mistakes

**Mistake:** Too much text
**Problem:** Not scannable, requires effort
**Solution:** 2-3 lines description max, 3-5 bullets

**Mistake:** Feature-focused instead of benefit-focused
**Problem:** Doesn't answer "why should I care?"
**Solution:** Always lead with outcome

### 11.4 Design Mistakes

**Mistake:** Bump looks hidden/hard to notice
**Problem:** Low visibility = low take rate
**Solution:** Subtle highlight, clear separation

**Solution:** Match page design, elegant not pushy

### 11.5 Ethical Mistakes

**Mistake:** Tricking customers into adding bump
**Problem:** Refunds, complaints, reputation damage
